Launch VS
Open top level folder that has all the asm / inc files and folders that comprise the source code

But either in ConTEXT open only main.asm
or on the cmd prompt navigate to main.asm

and F9 to execute the Compile.bat script
or on cmd prompt launch manually or type in the commands individually

basically you want to assemble and link

e.g.
wla-z80 -o FairyForest.asm FairyForest.o
wlalink -drvs link_file.txt FairyForest.sms


Great example is on Linux as delves into this further:

wla-dx.txt
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\Blogger\Z80
