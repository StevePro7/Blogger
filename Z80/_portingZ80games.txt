Porting Z80 games
12/12/2020


Now that all setup for z80 development in VS Code and have the latest wla-z80 + wlalink 
setup on Windows and Linux can start to port some old Z80 code games

IMPORTANT

01.
On Windows this is OK
PlayerCar_Tiles:
   .include "Race\PlayerCar_tiles.inc"

but not on Linux
so in order to be compatible on both systems
prefer

PlayerCar_Tiles:
   .include "Race/PlayerCar_tiles.inc"



02.
Also not too sure of when and how the next one
but I found that sometimes will get an error
if the variables are too close together
e.g.
MegaMan

so simply add another space between the variable definitions and everything is then fine


ALSO
can disassemble and re-assemble as before using smsexamine and ConTEXT
don't forget to include all the dat files with the main.asm
