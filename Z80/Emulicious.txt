Emulicious
05/09/2020


Load SMS file into Emulicious
copy + paste all generated ASM
manually set all .incbin
Re-assembly ASM in ConTeXT
but when F12 Emulicious launch but NOT load output.sms

Sooo
I rename 
Emulicious.ini
E:\Emulicious\

Then I get latest Emulicious and configure updates
Now magically works again

but I had to reconfigure some stuff again:
Graphcis menu

Debugger menu
Navigate | Follow current instruction
View | Highlight Tracing	UNCHECKED


IMPORTANT
You must have an Outline on the LHS of the Debugger
otherwise you can't F3 or Ctrl+click on label to navigate there

NB:
Alt+left navigates back
