<u>Summary</u><br />
Now that we have setup a productive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80</a> assembler development environment and better understand this relationship between source code written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS">devkitSMS</a> and the underlying Z80 assembly code, we are now finally in a great spot to build our own Z80 projects from scratch for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System">Sega Master System</a>!



CLOSING notes

it still attracts interest as there are hints on coding a medium/large game using WLA-DX 

including other options for Z80 IDE using Eclipse

plus other information

on Visual Studio Code for SMS Development including sample SMS Framework to test drive.
