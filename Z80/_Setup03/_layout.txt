Build project in C using devkitSMS

01.
build output.sms WITHOUT output.map file
get all the Z80 assembly code + re-assemble like previous post
main.without_map.asm


02.
build output.sms WITH output.map
do NOT attempt to re-assemble as this won't work
however, this new main_with_map.asm will be used long term


03.
update / integrate the two main.*.asm files
use main 01 as base and bring all mapped vars etc. from main 02
into main 01
keep rebuilding and compare built output matches original
output.sms

TODO
utility x2	Comparison


04.
Modularize main.asm and split into multiple *.inc files
replicate the original devkitSMS file structure
manually disassemble some code not done even in output.map
by this point you can be "done"
but all code layout is in strict order as per original dump


05.
extra mile
ideally want to wrap all code with free sections
so they can "live" anywhere and not tied to strict layout
[above]

if get this working then in theory have complete game
"written" from scratch in Z80 assembly
as this is what you could have done from the get go!
