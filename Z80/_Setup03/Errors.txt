Errors
06/03/2021


So trying to rebuild from the project ground up
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\VanHalenSMSII\asm\65

01.
but I get the wla-dx assembler error
Compile
Link
main.o: devkit/sms_manager.inc:592: FIX_REFERENCES: Reference to an unknown label "__divu8".
Run


I think this is because there is an underscore in the label name
and that is not allowed??

Referenced:
GOOGLE
wla-dx fix_references to an unknown label


Stumble onto this page:
https://githubmemory.com/@vhelin?page=4

search for FIX_REFERENCES

In 9.7b, this builds as expected with the label being correctly resolved.

Starting in 9.11 you recieve the following error;

FIX_REFERENCES: Reference to an unknown label "partialLabel_1"

If you insert a space between the @ and the + operator, it assembles correctly. This leads me to believe there is a parsing error with the @ arg when evaluating macros.


which made me think that cannot use underscore
so will take them all out and see what happens


02.
main.o: main.asm: INSERT_SECTIONS: No room for section "Content section" (20 bytes) in ROM bank 0.

/* FREE & SEMIFREE sections */
fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s: INSERT_SECTIONS: No room for section \"%s\" (%d bytes) in ROM bank %d.\n", get_file_name(s->file_id),

03.
Compile
Link
main.o: devkit/psg_manager.inc:508: FIX_REFERENCES: Too large distance (837 bytes from $c5c to $fa2 "LABEL_5B1_") for a relative 8-bit reference.
Run
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\VanHalenSMSII\asm\65>

So I wrapped the caller function with the callee function
e.g.
PSGSFXStop
LABEL_5B1_
