Disassembly
06/03/2021


Breakthru today!
couldn't understand why source code steps to a certain point and then
break points become invalid and won't step and actually steps into
disassembly

Believe the reason is 
Lmain.main$global_pause$1$55

i.e.
we use previous disassembled variable and this causes issues??
either way when I change to $C000 everything is fine


I still can't debug step thru all the code so I think the disassembly
code that I borrowed is causing an issue!!
