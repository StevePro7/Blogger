03. disassemble
16/01/2021


However, we can disassemble "famous" SMS games using Emulicious
and "extract" / generate the main.asm file [plus the data files]
and repeat this process to better understand the original source code!


Here is the process:
find a game we would like to rebuild / debug step thru the original source code
e.g.
WonderBoy SMS

Download ROM e.g. WonderBoy.sms
Load in Emulicious
Launch debugger
Ctrl+A select all disassembled Z80 source code
save into file e.g. WonderBoy.asm

Run utility:
configure 3x things:
fileName:	e.g. WonderBoy
copy 2x files to input folder
WonderBoy.sms
WonderBoy.asm

Run utility.exe

this will create output folder [if not exists]
and copy original ASM file to generic main.asm
and extract all the corresponding DAT files to be included via "incbin ..." statements

Now complete process as before with HelloWorld, CarRacer,... MegaMan etc

Create folder
WonderBoySMS

copy in the following files from HelloWorld [previous post]
build.bat
build.sh
.vscode folder
launch.json
tasks.json

finally copy the generated above 
main.asm
and the data folder with all corresponding DAT files

01.
Build, Link, Run
Ctrl+Shift+B

02.
F5 to debug step thru the z80 source code

Viola!
you should be able to complete this process with hopefully pretty much any original SMS game
with some exceptions e.g. Space Harrier
