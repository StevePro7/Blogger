<u>Commercial Games</u><br />
Now let us enhance this process to disassemble some commercial games built for the Sega Master System.  This way, we may gain insight into the early development process plus be able to hack original source code!
<br /><br />
<b>Transbot</b><br />
Create C:\Transbot or ~/Transbot folder.  Copy <b>.vscode</b> folder from above with launch.json and tasks.json files.  Copy build.bat + build.sh too.  Don't forget to grant execute permission chmod +x build.sh command.
<br /><br />
Download Transbot ROM.  Launch Emulicious | Open ROM.  Tools menu | Debugger | press Ctrl + A to select all disassembled code.  Save as Transbot.asm.  Update all ".incbin ..." statements using the following utility:
<br /><br />
<i>Utility</i><br />
Download Binary-File-Write utility.  Copy both Transbot.asm and Transbot.sms files to input folder.  Update the config file | set key="fileName" value to "Transbot".  Run BinaryFileWrite.exe.  Copy output to Transbot folder.
<br /><br />
Launch VS Code.  Open Transbot folder.  All ".incbin" statements should now refer to binary data files.  
  
<br /><br />
Download Transbot ROM.  Launch Emulicious | Open ROM.  Tools menu | Debugger | press Ctrl + A to select all disassembled code.  Save Transbot.asm.  Replace all ".incbin ..." references to DAT files using  Binary-File-Write utility.
  <br /><br />
Download ROM.  Launch Emulicious | open ROM.  Tools menu | Debugger.    In Debugger window | Ctrl + A to select all disassembled code.  Save Transbot.asm.  Next, use the Binary-File-Write utility to replace all ".incbin ..." with DAT files.
  <br /><br />
  
  Copy <b>.vscode</b> folder from previous post with launch.json + tasks.json.  Copy build.bat + build.sh.  Don't forget to grant execute permission chmod +x build.sh command.
  <br /><br />
  After checkout homebrew games let's disassemble some commercial games to compare and constrast development 
  e.g. Flicky for SG-1000
  Create folder C:\Flicky
  Copy the following folder and files from Hello World [previous post]
  .vscode => launch.json + tasks.json
  build.bat + build.sh
  bullet points
  Download ROM
  Launch Emulicious
  Open Flicky.sg ROM
  Tools menu | Debugger.  In the Debugger window | Ctrl + A to select all disassembled code.  Save Flicky.asm
  Use BinaryFileWrite utility to replace all the ".incbin ..." statements with actual binary data files
  TODO => Rename Flicky.sg as Flicky.sms as UTIL only works with SMS file extension
  Copy both Flicky.asm and Flicky.sms to bin/Debug/input folder
  Update BinaryFileWrite.exe.config folder => set key="fileName" value to filename e.g. "Flicky"
  Double click EXE to generate in output folder new "Flicky" folder and main.asm and data folder
  Copy main.asm and data folder to C:\Flicky
  Launch VS Code
  Open folder C:\Flicky
  Ctrl + Shift + B to build output.sms
  Launch Emulicious
  Press F5 to debug step thru code
  Remember on Mac + Linux to chmod +x build.sh
