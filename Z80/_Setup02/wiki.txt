In the previous post, we checked out Z80 Programming Setup for the Sega Master System: an 8-bit video game console based on the Z80 chip.  Here we used WLA-DX assembler for our development environment.
<br /><br />
Now that we are setup, we would like to analyze existing Indie game projects for the Sega Master System and disassemble some classic 8-bit commercial games to better understand the Z80 development process.

<u>Summary</u><br />
Now that we have a productive Z80 assembler development environment we are in a great spot to analyze existing Indie game projects directly from the SMS Power! <a href="https://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/Index">Homebrew</a> section and 8-bit commercial <a href="https://coolrom.com.au/roms/mastersystem">games</a>!  This will be the topic of the next post.
