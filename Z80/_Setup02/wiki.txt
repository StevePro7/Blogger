Commercial Games<br />
  After checkout homebrew games let's disassemble some commercial games to compare and constrast development 
  e.g. Flicky for SG-1000
  Create folder C:\Flicky
  Copy the following folder and files from Hello World [previous post]
  .vscode => launch.json + tasks.json
  build.bat + build.sh
  bullet points
  Download ROM
  Launch Emulicious
  Open Flicky.sg ROM
  Tools menu | Debugger.  In the Debugger window | Ctrl + A to select all disassembled code.  Save Flicky.asm
  Use BinaryFileWrite utility to replace all the ".incbin ..." statements with actual binary data files
  TODO => Rename Flicky.sg as Flicky.sms as UTIL only works with SMS file extension
  Copy both Flicky.asm and Flicky.sms to bin/Debug/input folder
  Update BinaryFileWrite.exe.config folder => set key="fileName" value to filename e.g. "Flicky"
  Double click EXE to generate in output folder new "Flicky" folder and main.asm and data folder
  Copy main.asm and data folder to C:\Flicky
  Launch VS Code
  Open folder C:\Flicky
  Ctrl + Shift + B to build output.sms
  Launch Emulicious
  Press F5 to debug step thru code
  Remember on Mac + Linux to chmod +x build.sh
