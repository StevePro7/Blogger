In the previous post, we checked out Z80 Programming Setup for the Sega Master System: an 8-bit video game console based on the Z80 chip.  Here we used WLA-DX assembler for our development environment.
<br /><br />
Now that we are setup, we would like to analyze existing Indie game projects for the Sega Master System and disassemble some classic 8-bit commercial games to better understand the Z80 development process.
<br /><br />
Let's check it out!

<u>Software</u><br />
Follow all instructions from the previous post: this documents how to setup all the pre-requisite software.
Note: ensure you have downloaded and installed WLA-DX assembler + Visual Studio Code cross platform.

Intro</br>
In the previous post we setup Z80 ASM dev env + simple Hello World program.  Now we'd like to build our own from scratch.  But first we need to build on Hello World and want to check out medium to large homebrew projects to gain better understanding how to achive this.  Also, disassemble commercial games written back in the day.  Finally, if too daunting then could always leverage 5yrs SMS dev using C + devkitSMS on SDCC to better understand compiled Z80 code generated in order to build Z80 asm project from scratch.

Begin with Car Racer tutorial
which goes in much depth to build an SMS game from scratch
written in pure Z80 assebmly

e.g.
Sega Console Programming
However, all assembly programming and machine code written thus far require a BASIC program driver; Cartridge-based video games built for 8-bit Sega Retro Gaming consoles were written in pure assembly!
