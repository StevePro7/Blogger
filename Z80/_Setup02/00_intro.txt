Intro</br>
In the previous post we setup Z80 ASM dev env + simple Hello World program.  Now we'd like to build our own from scratch.  But first we need to build on Hello World and want to check out medium to large homebrew projects to gain better understanding how to achive this.  Also, disassemble commercial games written back in the day.  Finally, if too daunting then could always leverage 5yrs SMS dev using C + devkitSMS on SDCC to better understand compiled Z80 code generated in order to build Z80 asm project from scratch.

In the previous post
blah blah blah


Begin with Car Racer tutorial
which goes in much depth to build an SMS game from scratch
written in pure Z80 assebmly

e.g.
Sega Console Programming
However, all assembly programming and machine code written thus far require a BASIC program driver; Cartridge-based video games built for 8-bit Sega Retro Gaming consoles were written in pure assembly!
