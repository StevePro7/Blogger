Begin with Car Racer tutorial
which goes in much depth to build an SMS game from scratch
written in pure Z80 assebmly
https://www.smspower.org/Articles/CreateARacingGame

e.g.
Sega Console Programming
However, all assembly programming and machine code written thus far require a BASIC program driver; Cartridge-based video games built for 8-bit Sega Retro Gaming consoles were written in pure assembly!


Launch VS Code
Launch Emulicious

Create folder
CarRacerSMS
copy in the following files from HelloWorld [previous post]
build.bat
build.sh
.vscode folder
launch.json
tasks.json

finally copy game code main.asm from 
C:\Users\TEST.000\Downloads\Racer-SMS-2.00\Racer (classic)\Version 1.12
to CarRacerSMS

Follow along the tutorial to better understand what all the Z80 code does
01.
Build, Link, Run
Ctrl+Shift+B

02.
F5 to debug step thru the z80 source code
