Intro
intro follow on but checkout ASM examples "bigger" than Hello World
e.g.
Homebrew code bases

AND disassemble commercial games to better understnad how to build
Z80 ASM game from scratch


Also compare devkitSMS code build in C compiled using SDCC to generate
Z80 ASM to complete picture
e.g.
VH covers

Let's check it out!


Homebrew
Car Racers tutorial
classic
rebooted
other HB projects
table


Commercial games
disassemble process / method
Utility to generate DAT files
other games
table


devkitSMS
above = good references but
still could be daunting to build entire ASM project from scratch so...
example VH covers SMS project
C => Z80
method to disassemble
modularize for better readability


SUMMARY
final step is to replace hardcoded 16-bit addresses with labels
modularize in .section free directives
and would be basis to rebuild ASM code from scratch!
