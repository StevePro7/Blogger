In 2013, we checked out Sega Console Programming to setup our game development environment for the Sega Master System: an 8-bit video game console based on the Z80 chip.  Here we use WLA-DX assembler.
<br /><br />
REMEMBER<br />
Original cartridge-based video games built for 8-bit Sega Retro Gaming consoles were written in assembly!  
<br /><br />
 
Now we would like to extend our game development environment to Windows and Mac OS/X and Linux for cross platform development and also add better support for automated builds with debugging functionality.
