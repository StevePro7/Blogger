  In 2013, we checked out Sega Console Programming to setup video game development environment for the Sega Master System: an 8-bit video game console based on the Z80 chip.  Here we used WLA-DX assembler.  Remember, original cartridge-based video games built for 8-bit Sega Retro Gaming consoles were written in pure assembly!
