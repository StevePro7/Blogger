In 2013, we checked out Sega Console Programming to setup our game development environment for the Sega Master System: an 8-bit video game console based on the Z80 chip.  Here we use WLA-DX assembler.
<br /><br />
REMEMBER<br />
Original cartridge-based video games built for 8-bit Sega Retro Gaming consoles were written in assembly!  
  <br /><br />
  
Now we would like to extend our game development environment to Windows and Mac OS/X and Linux for cross platform development and also add better support to automate builds and debugging functionality.

  using the Z80 chip as the last ever 8-bit video game console manufactured by Sega built using the Z80 chip.  Here we setup the WLA-DX asembler and went thru the Hello World introductory program from Maxim's World of Stuff.  The main issue is that these binaries are outdated and focused only on Windows PC.  Now, we would like to upgrade the setup and develop Z80 ASM cross platform on Win, Mac, Lin.  Let's check it out!
