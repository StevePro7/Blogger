Intro: in 2013 we checked out Sega Console Programming to initially setup 8-bit video game development for the Sega Master System using the Z80 chip as the last ever 8-bit video game console manufactured by Sega built using the Z80 chip.  Here we setup the WLA-DX asembler and went thru the Hello World introductory program from Maxim's World of Stuff.  The main issue is that these binaries are outdated and focused only on Windows PC.  Now, we would like to upgrade the setup and develop Z80 ASM cross platform on Win, Mac, Lin.  Let's check it out!
