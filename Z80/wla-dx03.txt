For completeness, installed wla-dx on the Mac

here is how:

Reference
http://macappstore.org/wla-dx


Mac OS/X
Launch Terminal
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null


prompt to install the latest Xcode tools
Yes



Error: 
  homebrew-core is a shallow clone.
To `brew update`, first run:
  git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow
This restriction has been made on GitHub's request because updating shallow
clones is an extremely expensive operation due to the tree layout and traffic of
Homebrew/homebrew-core and Homebrew/homebrew-cask. We don't do this for you
automatically to avoid repeatedly performing an expensive unshallow operation in
CI systems (which should instead be fixed to not use shallow clones). Sorry for
the inconvenience!



brew update --force
ERROR


sooo type the following:
Terminal
git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow


Now
brew update --force


Finally
brew install wla-dx


Terminal
the following commands will now work
wla-z80
wlalink



Mac OS/X
Launch VS Code

I think that I have code runner installed so this is how you can auto run

Windows key + Alt + N
./build.sh

I tried to F5 but the Emulicious debugger sort of stalls
plus you need to have Emulicious running before F5 otherwise you will receive the "connection" error
