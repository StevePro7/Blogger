AA	Setup
01.
HelloWorld assemble + debug step thru code using Meka Debugger
awsome but no Step Out functionality, limited window size, no watch or call stack windows 

advised that Emulicious is fuller featured, has improved debugging functionality
and is generally the goto emulator for Sega Master System development
[which we eventually setup in "Everdrive" blog post]


02.
wla-dx assembler version for the following utilities were old / outdated
wla-z80		assembler
wlalink		linker

and were for Windows OS only - we would like to work cross platform on
Win / Mac / Lin


03.
Advised that disassembler smsexamine was outdated and the built-in functionality
for Emulicious disassembling functionality for Z80 ASM produced better output
for when disassembling video game binaries and better understand / follow the code
and ideally have integrated debugging support within an IDE during development


Therefore, would like to combine all of these ideas:
- upgrade wla-dx
- setup better Z80 dev env
- that is cross plat

Hello World
Ctrl+Shift+B	build + run from VS Code
but no debugging support : next blog


BB.	Sample
disassemble video games to better understand
open folder in VS Code
build + run in VS Code

TOOD
check this method works for SG, SC and SMS


finally debug step thru source ASM Code:
use Emulicious Debugger in VS Code directly

extra for experts:
use these new found debugging skills to hack Flicky??
