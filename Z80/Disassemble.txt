Disassemble
30/08/2020



Today, I found a manual way to disassemble ROMs using Emulicious and build back
so I could re-write manually to better understand how the games worked
e.g.
Flicky
Transbot
Wonderboy

E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\ROM_Sega\8-bit\Disassemble\Flicky03_SMS
E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\ROM_Sega\8-bit\Disassemble\TransBot02_ENG
E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\ROM_Sega\8-bit\Disassemble\WonderboyII


Here is the basic method

Load the original ROM into Emulicious
Debugger

Ctrl+A to select the entire code
copy n' paste into Notepad++
save

for all the instances of:
.incbin ...

Emulicious will tell the start and end and how many bytes
run the BinaryFileWrite program to extract the required bytes
from the original ROM and save them into dat files
then manually replace the old .incbin ... with new:
e.g.
.incbin ...
.incbin "Flick.sms.data.99"

Dump the Emulicious.asm into ConTeXT and re-assemble and re-run in emulators
