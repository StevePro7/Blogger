Merge from Master to feature branch
Git pull latest code in master branch from remote into local branch.
Use Goland IDE.  Shelve any changes first i.e. have clean start.  Choose Git tab.  Right click on Remote => origin => master.  Choose Rebase  “<branch-name>” onto origin/master.  If there are conflicts then you will be prompted to Merge either choose Yours or Theirs i.e. your branch or their master.  OK.  

Once complete you should be able to regression test your changes integrated with latest master on your local branch, unshelve any previous code and continue etc.

Alternatively, use the following commands from the Terminal to Rebase


git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout peter-branch
git rebase origin/master
if successful (i.e. no conflicts) you usually get a message like
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/peter-branch
