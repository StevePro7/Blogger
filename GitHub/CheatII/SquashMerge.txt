Git Rebase Merge Squash


REBASE
Local | Right click feature branch | Checkout
Remote | origin | master | Right click master
Choose "Rebase <feature branch> onto origin/master"

IMPORTANT
If you get conflicts then choose "Accept Theirs" to easily resolve conflicts.

You must force push the changes now otherwise when you simply git push you may be prompted to git pull first

git push --force

Remote | origin | master | Right click master
Choose “Merge<feature branch> onto origin/master”

IMPORTANT
Do not choose “Pull into <feature branch> using Rebase” as this will include all history
Do not choose “Pull into <feature branch> using Merge” as this will include all history


SQUASH
repeat

git reset --soft <INITIAL_COMMIT_SHA>
git add .
git commit -m "Squash all commits"
