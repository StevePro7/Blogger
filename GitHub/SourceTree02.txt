Source Tree 02

UPDATE
I did all below but STILL kept getting prompted to enter username password

Hopefully this solved the issue once and for all!

The problem was the account
visual studio http saved password

this must be removed via the Windows Credential Mgr
Start | run | Credential Mgr

Windows credentials
scroll down to the two entries

GitHub for Visual Studio HTTPS
Remove


01.

First, post 2021 must use token [PAT] not username and password
e.g.
Tools | Options | Authentication | Add
github.com
OAuth
SteveProXNA


However, still being prompted for password - so try this

Click repo | Settings | origin | Edit

IMPORTANT
the wrong account was selected - StevePro7 - update to SteveProXNA

close Source Tree and re-open

NB: ensure the URL
https://github.com/SteveProXNA/awesome-megadrive.git


NB: some answer suggest putting the personal access token in the URL
https://{personal-access-token>@github.com}/{<my-repo>}.git>

OR
remove the origin first then re-add

git remote remove origin
https://{personal-access-token>@github.com}/{<my-repo>}.git>
