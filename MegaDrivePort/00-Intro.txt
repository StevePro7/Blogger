In 2017, we checked out devkitSMS Programming Setup
to build game code in C for the 8-bit Sega Master System [console]

In 2020, we checked out SGDK Programming Setup
to build game code in C for the 16-bit Sega Mega Drive

Leveraging all this knowledge, we would now like to port existing game code built for the 8-bit SMS 
e.g. Simpsons Trivia or Skazka to the 16-bit Mega Drive
