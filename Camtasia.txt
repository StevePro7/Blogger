Launch Camtasia

Weird - leave the audio cable in the back of the PC
Black cable in microphone and headphones and record



IMPORTANT
microphone choose Realtek audio


NB: you can choose camera for video that accepts your audio
ie. speech but then I don' know how you would also record PC sound??


Videos on Twitter
If you get the error "video is incompatible" then it is most likely 
because the video is >140s long

If you can't upload video to Twitter because of "Your video file is not compatible‚Äù, you must shorten the video duration and control it within 140 seconds. The prompt box will appear when you click to publish "Tweet".
