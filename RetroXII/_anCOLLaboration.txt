Another motivation to transition from 8-bit to 16-bit stems from earlier this year Sega Master System project Candy Kid as features were cut due to the constant challenge to stay within the 32KB ROM game code limit.
<br /><br />
     
Fortunately, Candy Kid being a Pacman clone, presents new opportunities to port to the Sega MegaDrive with additional capacity and the possibly to explore a connection between Artificial Intelligence and video games.
<br /><br />
  
  Video games are an interesting field of study for many Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers especially like Pacman because it is simple enough to be understood quickly and does not rquire powerful machine to run.
  
  <br /><br />
  since they provide complex but controlled environments in which many AI techniques can be studied and tested

  <u>Collaboration</u><br />
  After years of self publishing video game projects, concerns of an over-saturated marketplace and fears that it will soon be impossible to make any progress as an indie developer, it is becoming more apparent that the next phase of independent game development will be powered more by collaboration.

   <br /><br />

  The <i>network effect</i> of working collaboratively, where each person has enhanced access to various networks, may lead to future collaborations which could inevitably perpetuate throughout the indie game community.

Earlier in the year I was fortunate enough to collaborate with some of the coding elements on MARKanoIIId which was awesome and exposed stronger relationships with other developers, pixel artists and musicians.

  Discord is great vehicle also to encourage participation as I was fortunate to help test the new Emulicious VS Code plugin for the Master System.  I am hopeful experiences like these will broaden to the Sega MegaDrive!
