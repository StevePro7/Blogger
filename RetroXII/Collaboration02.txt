build a cooler ecosystem around Independent [Indie] game development








After many years as an independent game development, concerns about the indie game bubble, an over-saturated marketplace and fears that soon it will be impossible to make any [kind of headway] as an indie developer it is becoming more apparent that the next phase of indie game development will be powered more by collaboration.

The "network effect" which is the result of working collaboratively, where each person may have enhanced access to various personal networks of other people in the team, which may lead to possible future collaborations, which could inevitably perpetuate throughout the indie game community

After five years being involved with the SMS Power! community I was fortunate enough to collaborate with some of the coding elements on MARKanoIIId which was awesome and exposed stronger relationships with other developers, [pixel] artists and musicians

Discord is also useful to communicate directly with community members and build relationships; here I was able to collaborate with members of the Emulicious community and help test the latest Visual Studio Code Z80 debugging features in the Emulicious plugin
one of the most popular emulators for the Sega Master System


this year also Collaborate on testing Emulicious for remote debugging
e.g.
Z80
VS Code plugin
