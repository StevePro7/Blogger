This blog began in 2009 and initially centered around game development initially centered around XNA

Over the years the blog has morphed [expanded] into 
various topics focused on software engineering

however, the goal has always been to share information and help the software community

Back in 2009, it was XNA and XBLIG community.  After XNA "died" around 2012 the knowledge + experience transferred from XNA 4.0 to MonoGame
as an open source port of XNA 4.0


from 2013 onwards, initially to celebrate the 30yrs anniversary of the first Sega product SG-1000 and SC-3000

and to celebrate 8-bit preservation and fanaticism => SMS Power

List reviews + stuff over 5yrs


Now would like to transfer this 8-bit experience in C with SMS using devkitSMS
to 16-bit also in C for MD but using SGDK
want to transfer ideas and similar dev setup from 8-bit to 16-bit
 


OR
begin XNA and help XBLIG community by blogging about experiences
XNA dead so wanted to join another community
chose SMS Power! because grew up on 8-bit Sega learnt to program etc
owned SMS etc.
5yrs solid
mentioned stuff
collaborate on MarkanoIIId

Now want to see if can transfer 8-bit to 16-bit

after 5yrs SMS development involvement in the community and to help promote SMS games

as very focused on AI / ML / DL
both linux and python based on C - same prog lang as
