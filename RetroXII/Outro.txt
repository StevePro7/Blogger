Therefore, it may be curious to wonder in this day and age why concentrate on C lanugate

To a lot of people C is still the lingua franca of software engineering
Think of a machine

Linux, the largest open source project on the planet is written in C.

Python, the current backbone of AI / ML / DL and goto source for modern AI "development"
is written in C

And many top libraries used for ML are written in C or C++

Therefore, it will be very interesting to determine if programming techniques used in 
8-bit and 16-bit retro gaming console projects [can be applied] apply here to modern AI
