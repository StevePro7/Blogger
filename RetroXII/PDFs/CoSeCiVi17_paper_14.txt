Abstract. Video games are an interesting field of study for many ar-
tiicial intelligence researchers, since many dierent AI methods can be
studied and tested with them, and later those investigations can be ap-
plied to many other situations.


Video games are an interesting field of study for many Artiicial Intelligence
(AI) researchers, since they provide complex but controlled environments in
which many AI techniques can be studied and tested. Video games are also very
interesting to compare dierent AI techniques and learn their strengths and
weaknesses.


Pac-Man may seem simple compared to
some other kind of games, its special features make it a perfect target for AI
researchers. Firstly, this game is simple enough to be quickly understood and it
does not require a very powerful machine to be run. On the other hand, in spite
of its simplicity, lots of dierent strategies can be applied while playing, some of
them more intelligent than others, so it is the task of AI techniques to discover
the best strategies
