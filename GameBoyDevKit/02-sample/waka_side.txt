In the previous post, we checked out GBDK Programming Setup. The <a href="https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020">GBDK</a> is a cross-platform development kit for sm83, z80 and 6502 based gaming consoles including the Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Color.
<br /><br />
Using the GBDK, it is now possible to write game code using the C language rather than pure Z80 assembly. Therefore, we would like to extend this knowledge and checkout some code samples and homebrew games.
