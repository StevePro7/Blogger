<u>Separation</u>
<br />
As projects became larger they seemed longer to build.  Traditionally, this has been because all the code has been spread across multiple header files but with only 1x main.c which forces a complete rebuild each time.
<br /><br />
Therefore, in an attempt to improve build compile times, we'd like to separate interface from implementation code: keep header files lean with goal that static code in translation units need not be constantly recompiled!
<br /><br />
Note: here object file would have to be version controlled and build script may change during development.
