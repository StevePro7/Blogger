SMS Manager
17/04/2019


After build.bat write this continuation:

One issue found with this is that it seems that SMSlib.h and PSGlib.h could only be included once
e.g. previously in main.h as with all other header files would be included in the main.c file


Now that the source code is scaled out across multiple translation units it seems that in its current incarnation SMSlib.h and PSGlib.h cannot be #include more than once because there don't seem to be any header include guard clauses.

No matter, we can wrap the SMSlib.h and PSGlib.h files in our own SMS Manager and PSG Manager files that act as wrappers around the original lib header files

NOTE: by doing this could actually be advantageous if we would like to try and integrate compilation and debugging later on in the project


<pre class="csharp" name="code">
_sms_manager.h
#ifndef _SMS_MANAGER_H_
#define _SMS_MANAGER_H_

void devkit_SMS_init();
void devkit_SMS_displayOn();
void devkit_SMS_displayOff();
void devkit_SMS_mapROMBank( unsigned char n );


// input
unsigned int devkit_SMS_getKeysStatus();
unsigned int devkit_PORT_A_KEY_UP();
unsigned int devkit_PORT_A_KEY_DOWN();
unsigned int devkit_PORT_A_KEY_LEFT();
unsigned int devkit_PORT_A_KEY_RIGHT();
unsigned int devkit_PORT_A_KEY_1();
unsigned int devkit_PORT_A_KEY_2();

// #defines
unsigned char devkit_SPRITEMODE_NORMAL();
unsigned int devkit_VDPFEATURE_HIDEFIRSTCOL();

#endif//_SMS_MANAGER_H_
</pre>


Repeat the same for PSG Manager


IMPORTANT
Don't show the implementation _sms_manager.c file YET!
I want to show this later on the compile and debugger stage
