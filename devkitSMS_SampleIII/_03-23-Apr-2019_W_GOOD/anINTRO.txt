In 2017, we did devkitSMS Programming Setup to "produce" build productive environment in order to build SMS games / 8-bit retro games for Sega MS
CandyKidDemo

In 2018, we did devkitSMS Programming Setup II to enhance productive environment:
centralize utilities
graphics
batch scripts for content

Now, we would like con't to enhance productive build environment to build SMS games as some things were missing:

VS2008 eventually will not be supported so good opportunity to upgrade to VS2015 [or VS2017]
Projects get larger need a way to scale out code and reduce compile times
Graphics had a "hacky" way to ensure the palette for background or sprite tiles were the same

Biggest Q: could it be possible to debug C source code for devkitSMS in Visual Studio
Believe it is not possible [reason]

but if not is there a halfway house that can at least step thru the ANSI-C source code at least??
