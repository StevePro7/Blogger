<u>Visual Studio</u>
<br />
In 2017, we were inspired by this suggestion to use Visual Studio as an IDE to better navigate files in larger projects and help automate the development build system.  Now it is time to upgrade from VS2008 to 2015.
<br /><br />
The motivation here assumes a point where it is difficult / impossible to use Visual Studio 2008 on Windows PC.  Plus Visual Studio 2015 has a cool feature to easily Toggle Header / Code files for increased productivity.
<br /><br />
Replicate all instructions from here: Setup External Tools to integrate the build process directly from within Visual Studio and connect "Run Batch File" command to Ctrl+1 hot key to automatically build and execute code!
