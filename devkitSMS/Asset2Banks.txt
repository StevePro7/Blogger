Asset2 Banks
19-Dec-2024


Finally tried asset2banks!

OLD
folder2c bank2 bank2 2

NEW
assets2banks bank2 --firstbank=2


Differences
main diff is that the header files specifies the bounded array
e.g.
OLD
extern const unsigned char level1_metatiles_bin[];

NEW
extern const unsigned char level1_metatiles_bin[952];


Plus there are less line gaps between the entries
