<b>Buffer Overflow</b><br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">Buffer overflow</a> [or overrun] is an anomaly where writing data to buffer overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory.  In Candy Kid, the player can be killed by any one of the three Mama enemies; Actors 0-2.  But Kid can also be killed by death tree ie "actor" 4.  When Kid is killed we initially reset the "kill" enemy unconditionally.  Thus if killed by death tree enemy "4" would be reset hence a buffer overrun occurs!  Big thanks to <a href="http://www.smspower.org/forums/member6944">Calindro</a> + <a href="https://www.smspower.org/forums/member7198">sverx</a> for helping debug this issue.  The solution is to check enemy kill before reset.
