Persisting important data like hi scores, player settings, checkpoints, game settings etc makes for a better user experience and is actually very simple to implement with the current version of the devkitSMS includes SRAM support

The current version of the devkitSMS includes SRAM support which is awesome for persisting important game data across console game play sessions like hi scores, player settings, checkpoints and game play progress.  

I believe persisting player settings makes for a better user experience and is actually very simple to implement

sverx has a simple example here

However, here is the version used in Candy Kid which uses the new debug integration support:
