In 2017, we checked out devkitSMS to setup productive development environment to build 8-bit retro video games for the Sega Master System.  In 2018, we streamlined this build process to develop Simpsons Trivia.

However, as projects became larger they seemed longer to build.  Plus it didn't seem possible to debug step through C source code.  Look for opportunities to improve the process further as we build Platform Explorer!
