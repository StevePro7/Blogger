Follow up on devkitSMS II
but instead of VS2008 do VS2015

Why?
Abit faster on debug (x86)
E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\sdcc2\Test2015


Also mention can run both
z80	F5	debug
x86	Ctrl+1	run


Project properties
right click Game project
Properties
Configuration Properties
General
Output directory		$(SolutionDir)..\bin\$(ConfigurationName)
Intermediate directory		$(SolutionDir)..\obj\$(ConfigurationName)
leave all other default
Apply | OK

Also, get rid of x64 build configuration as not needed

Build | Configuration Manager
Active soltuion platform
<Edit...>
x64
Remove
OK


EXAMPLE
E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\sdcc2\Test2015_02_MM\dev

I had to run folder2c but F5 still gave issues
so I included gfx.h and gfx.c and clean solution then rebuilt solution
Now F5 steps thru code OK



disassemble as done previously as I like to see if tiles loaded ok in meka
copy output.sms ..\asm
cd ..\asm
smsexamine.exe output.sms
cd ..\dev
