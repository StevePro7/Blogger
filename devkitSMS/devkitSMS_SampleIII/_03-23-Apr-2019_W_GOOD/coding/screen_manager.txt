screen manager
17/04/2019


Following on from devkitSMS II 
Array of Function Pointers
this was for the screen load() and update() functions

As the game grows in scale and there are more screens available [state design pattern]
it makes sense to factor ou this bloated code out into its own screen_manager component


void engine_screen_manager_init( unsigned char open_screen_type )
{
	next_screen_type = open_screen_type;
	curr_screen_type = screen_type_none;

	// Set load methods.
	load_method[ screen_type_none ] = screen_none_screen_load;
	load_method[ screen_type_splash ] = screen_splash_screen_load;
	load_method[ screen_type_intro ] = screen_intro_screen_load;
// ...
}

void engine_screen_manager_update()
{
	if( curr_screen_type != next_screen_type )
	{
		curr_screen_type = next_screen_type;
		load_method[ curr_screen_type ]();
	}

	update_method[ curr_screen_type ]( &next_screen_type );
}
