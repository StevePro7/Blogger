devkitSMS III
Intro

VS2015 upgrade
why?
avail of toggle *.h and *.c files


Discuss larger project
therefore split out all *.h to *.h and *.c files
Build each translation unit
and for static modules that code never changes
e.g. engine modules then don't need to rebuild or include header files each time
more fast compile build times

downside is that every now and again have to do full rebuild
not sure if that is because of cyclical depenedencies??
