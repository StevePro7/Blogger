devkitSMS Programming Sample II

Software
Follow all instructions from the previous post: this documents how to setup the pre-requisite software. 
Note: ensure you have downloaded and installed the devkitSMS and Small Device C Compiler [SDCC]. 



BMP2Tile 
Previous work using BMP2Tile was a very manual process: Launch BMP2Tile | drag n' drop the 4bpp image into BMP2Tile and manually configure options and save out the Tiles, Tilemap and Palette files one by one.


DON'T FORGET to include link for v0.43 and have the gfx script for AllPalette option
