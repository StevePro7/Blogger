Build.bat
08/12/2021

Ctrl+Shfit+B to build code

Weird - previous versions of tasks.json on Windows used
    "windows": {
        "command": "build.bat"
      },

However, on the new Windows 10 laptop this gave an error

build.bat : The term 'build.bat' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the 
spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

The terminal process "C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command build.bat" terminated with exit code: 1


01.	try to update Powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy 
e.g.
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine

But did not work OR change anything

A workaround is to do this
    "windows": {
        "command": "${workspaceFolder}/build.bat"
      },


02.	try this instead:
    "windows": {
        "command": "./build.bat"
      },

this evening I had all sorts of nonsense setting up on Linux
build.sh


Issue:
the org build.sh script was copy n' paste build.bat from Windows!


Answer
delete org build.sh
create new build.sh
dump all the content into the new file

chmod +x build.sh
now wired up via VS Code
