<u>Microservices</u><br />
Microservices have become a game-changer in the quickly changing technological landscape where flexibility, speed and scalability are crucial.  Microservices architecture provides a more agile and effective substitute to conventional monolithic techniques and has seen rapidly increasing industry adoption in recent years.
<br /><br />
Microservices align seamlessly with DevOps principles, fostering development and operations collaboration for continuous delivery and automation.  Microservices architecture also aligns with containerization and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, simplifying the deployment and management of services at scale.
<br /><br />
Industry predictions in Microservices expect growth to $1.7b by 2028 as 82% of organizations plan to adopt microservices in the next 3yrs.  Microservices are well-suited to leverage emerging technologies such as IoT, edge computing, and blockchain and A.I. has potential to disrupt and innovate in the microservices space.
<br /><br />
