Software architecture plays a crucial role in designing and developing effective software systems.  By  understanding the various architectural systems and patterns available, you can make informed decisions in your ar


CQRS and Event Sourcing for Software Architecture.
https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/cqrs-and-event-sourcing-for-software-architecture

CQRS suggests having different models for reading and writing data in an application
The read model returns data in a format that the UI can consume and is optimized for commands
By separating the read and write models CQRS address complex scaling and inefficient search issues by enabling independent model optimizations for each 

Event Sourcing
Event sourcing records a system's status as a series of events.  Each event is recorded in an append-only log and symbolizes a change in the system's state.  Replaying the events in the log yields the system's current state
