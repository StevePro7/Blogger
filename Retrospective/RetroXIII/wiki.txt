<u>Cgo</u><br />
CGo is a technology which allows Go programs to interoperate with C libraries.  For example distributed cloud computing packages that consume <b>ModSecurity</b> C/C++ library for Web Applicaton Firewall (WAF) detection.
<br /><br />
Another example <b>eBPF</b>: a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed C programs safely and efficiently extending the capabilities of the Linux kernel, without requiring changes to kernel source code or load kernel modules, consumed from Go packages providing high-performance networking in cloud native environments.

<u>Summary</u><br />
Writing low level C code to target 8-bit Sega Master System hardware and now the 16-bit Sega MegaDrive it has proved to be very valuable experience to build Cloud Computing, Go and CGo applications going forward.  The next challenge is port projects exclusively on Windows and include Linux system builds cross platform <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span>
