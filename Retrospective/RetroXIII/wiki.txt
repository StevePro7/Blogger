C?  Go?  Cgo!  CGo is a technology which allows Go programs to interoperate with C libraries.  One example could be a distributed cloud computing package that needs to consume a C/C++ library such as ModSecurity for cross platform Web Applicaton Firewall (WAF) detection.
<br /><br />
Another example <b>eBPF</b>: a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed C programs safely and efficiently extending the capabilities of the Linux kernel, without requiring changes to kernel source code or load kernel modules, consumed from Go packages providing high-performance networking in cloud native environments.
