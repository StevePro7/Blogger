01. Python
Clean code, code quality, code architecture
Outcome
Drive book club - team knowledge transfer

ORG
Why this version is especially strong
Specific: Refactoring, reuse, duplication reduction
Measurable: Documentation + review signals + duplication reduction
Senior-level impact: Influences architecture without owning every line
Credible: Fluent Python is perfect justification for this focus


NEW
Attainable: Incremental refactoring via existing workflows and bi-weekly discussions
Relevant: Improves Python maintainability, architecture consistency, and team knowledge sharing


Longer
Attainable: Achievable within normal development workflows by leveraging bi-weekly discussions, existing refactoring cycles, and senior-level influence rather than large-scale rewrites.

Relevant: Directly improves Python code quality, maintainability, and architectural consistency while reinforcing team knowledge sharing and engineering best practices.



Deadlines
Goal
01.	Python		Q3	2026
02.	Azure ML	Q2	2026
03.	3D		Q1	2026
04.	DEV		Q4	2026


01. Python Code Quality drive
Lead team book club focused on Fluent Python facilitating in [bi-]weekly discussions to
translate key concepts into actionable refactoring guidelines with Python coding standards
that promote code quality, reuse, composability, and reduced code duplication.

Specific: 	Code architecture, consistency, refactoring, reuse and code quality
Measurable:	Documented best practices + code review with duplication reduction
Attainable:	Achievable within normal workflows rather than large-scale re-writes
Relevant: 	Improve code maintainability while reinforcing shared team knowledge 
Time-bound:	Q3-2026


02. [Local] Azure MLOps Enablement
Evaluate local cost-effective MLOps reference environment [using MiniKube or KinD] to replicate key aspects of our Azure AKS-based runtime and deployment architecture and build transferable Kubernetes-based MLOps skills with the intent to progress learnings to deployed workloads hosted on Azure infrastructure.

Specific:	KinD or MiniKube, Azure AKS, Azure ML, CI/CD deployment
Measurable:	Environment built + documented workflows + cheat sheets
Attainable:	Replication from cloud to localhost without full parity
Relevant: 	Development productivity boost for Kubernetes workflows
Time-bound:	Q2-2026 


03. 3D migration
Help migrate existing PyTorch3D-based Deep Learning codebase into the team Mono Repo code base by transitioning existing dependency management from Conda to UV.  Also, prototype / port existing 3D Azure ML REST endpoint that serves Deep Learning model[s] to ensure functional parity with the new CI/CD automation pipeline for improved maintainability.

Specific:	PyTorch3D to Mono-repo with, UV and Azure ML endpoint
Measurable:	Code migrated, dependency switched, endpoint deployed
Attainable:	Functionality parity not feature expansion
Relevant: 	Platform consistency and Production impact
Time-bound:	Q1-2026 


04. Development goal: Python -> C/C++
Setup existing 3D mesh processing implemented in C/C++ consumed by Python, C#/.NET etc. on Mac OS for debug-step exploration to better understand how the API consumers interface with the underlying native code.  Successful completion of this goal could be to present all research here to the team while identifying opportunities for potential future collaboration.

Specific:	Python API, C/C++, PyBind11, C#/.NET and debugging
Measurable:	Codebase set up and presentation to team delivered
Attainable:	Learning with shared presentation but not refactoring
Relevant: 	Cross tech-stack understanding and knowledge transfer
Time-bound:	Q4-2026
