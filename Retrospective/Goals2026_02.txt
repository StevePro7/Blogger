01. Python
Clean code, code quality, code architecture
Outcome
Drive book club - team knowledge transfer

ORG
Why this version is especially strong
Specific: Refactoring, reuse, duplication reduction
Measurable: Documentation + review signals + duplication reduction
Senior-level impact: Influences architecture without owning every line
Credible: Fluent Python is perfect justification for this focus


NEW
Attainable: Incremental refactoring via existing workflows and bi-weekly discussions
Relevant: Improves Python maintainability, architecture consistency, and team knowledge sharing


Longer
Attainable: Achievable within normal development workflows by leveraging bi-weekly discussions, existing refactoring cycles, and senior-level influence rather than large-scale rewrites.

Relevant: Directly improves Python code quality, maintainability, and architectural consistency while reinforcing team knowledge sharing and engineering best practices.
