Candy Kid SMS project this year
Candy Kid = Pacman clone

Pacman good candidate for AI / ML / Re-inforcement learning in Video Games

01.
Candy Kid SMS
struggle to get code complete within tight 32KB ROM budget of SMS games
check out blog post that mentions this more
https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2020/05/devkitsms-programming-sample-iv.html


esp. as wanted to trial out Command Mgr to record + playback commands
which is very common / popular in video games e.g. initially for demo mode


Therefore, look to transition from 8-bit to 16-bit simply for more ROM storage for source code
NB: there are other reasons as outlined in the post


So look to transition skills from 8-bit SMS [using devkitSMS] to 16-bit MD [using SGDK]
success!

now more ROM available could port Candy Kid SMS to MD


Reference
last year retrospective wanted to check out reinforcement learning in video games
https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2020/05/devkitsms-programming-sample-iv.html


then as Candy Kid is Pacman clone and Pacman is good candidate for reinforcement learning in video games
and have more ROM storage to build game code then this could be perfect to being entry point for investigate 
AI / ML / RL in video games
