Here are some topics I can rattle off to complete retrospective blog:

Sega

acknowledge win SMS competition after 4yrs of entry and would like to enter 5th project
but ultimately like to apply all hard work here with techniques to different console
i.e. SGDK for MegaDrive plus the community here is big


MonoGame
nice community and opportunity to apply a lot of ideas using game dev from XNA over
but not sure the future of MG... is slowing down??
would be nice to get some 3D stuff cross platform as applicable using the APIs
to ultimately get closure on this framework
although knowledge of 3D graphics important if ever transitioned AI / ML
esp. Deep Learning with image recognition


Python
backbone language for AI + ML


containerization + orchestration
Docker and Kubernetes

Visual Studio Code
IDE used for write Python cross platform
although PyCharm can also be used

https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux


AI + ML
not going to be Data Scientist but want to be more involved
good start is Exploratory Data Analysis
then check out Google collab


presentation
Earlier in the year I gave a presentation about Retro Game Development

Finally nice way to end up:
Reinforcement Learning in Video Games
could this be an ultimate goal?
nice way to combine *love* of [old] video games esp. Retro with new AI + ML
i.e.
combine the old with the new
