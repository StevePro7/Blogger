<u>Blog</u><br />
This blog was created in <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2009/08/welcome-steveproxna.html">2009</a> after the completion of my first independent game built using XNA: <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2009/09/first-game-completion.html">Henway</a>.  The goal was to discuss issues found during independent game development and provide potential solutions.
<br /><br />
Ten years later and this blog has expanded ideas to modern agile software application in game development and the ability to scale game projects quickly cross multiple platforms while always being mindful of quality.
<br /><br />
During this time, XNA has given way to other frameworks and engines but MonoGame has proved to be most successful in terms of applying these ideas to new titles such as <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2015/05/candy-kid-video-game.html">Candy Kid</a>, <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2018/07/simpsons-trivia-xna-port.html">Simpsons Trivia</a> plus <a href="https://steveproxna.itch.io/retro-3d-city">3D City</a>.
<br /><br />
<br />
<u>History</u><br />
Conversely, much time has also been spent especially during the past five years programming older systems.  Writing low level code to run on real 8-bit hardware like the <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_Master_System">Sega Master System</a> with limited memory and storage requires performance-critical algorithms to be written to achieve maximum frame rate at all times.
<br /><br />
<br />
<u>Future</u><br />
The future in Software Engineering looks exciting as <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/13/linkedin-blockchain-developer-is-the-fastest-growing-u-s-job">LinkedIn</a> opportunities include Blockchain Developer, Machine Learning Engineer and Machine Learning Specialist as part of the top five emerging jobs in 2018.
<br /><br />
Therefore, frameworks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a> for example, used in machine learning applications available cross multiple platforms in both high + low level languages seem very aligned to approaches used in this blog <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span>
