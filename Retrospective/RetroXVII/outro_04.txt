<u>Future</u><br />
In 2024 we checked out OpenAI Gym and Retro to provide early exposure to AI-centric principles integrating Reinforcement Learning environments using Python and C/C++ to upskill AI concepts such as agent training environment design reproducibility and iterative experimentation.
<br /><br />  
In 2025 we checked out Retro Achievements ecosystem to further deepen these skills dealing with emulation internals memory inspection and state tracking all highly relevant to RL and model-driven control systems.  
<br /><br />
Together this experience forms connection between long-standard Professional Software Engineer expertise and the emerging demands of AI Engineering.  Combining systems programming with complex environment instrumentation and practical RL-work aligns with one of the fastest-growing roles in the technology sector!
