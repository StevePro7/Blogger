I am a Professional Software Engineer for 20yrs coding in languages like Python C/C++ C#/.NET - I have recently extended skills to DevOps work - now AI and Machine Learning and Deep Learning is in demand - I would like to tell a story of 2x main paragraphs: #1 how would you extend existing DevOps work to ML Ops deploying models written by other ML Engineers while I learn ML and #2 my previous work in OpenAI Gym and Retro in 2024 and Retro Achievements work in Python and C/C++ could help my future career plan to become an AI Engineer which is one of the hottest Software roles in demand


That is great but could we pls re-write the 2x paragraphs not from my first person point of view but rather a more generic third person
