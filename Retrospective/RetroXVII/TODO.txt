04.
Python package mgt uv vs. poetry vs. pip theory learning

05.
Azure MLOps learning: image ACR, env, model, ep, deploy

06.
GitHub Actions learning crash course and ACT to run locally

07.
Explore explore Python => C/C++ alternatives e.g. ctypes
2D / 3D Meshes Linear Algebra C/C++ consumed by Python
// don't mention Ortho but generic application

08.
Simpsons Trivia R/A


Objectives
01.
Python package mgt uv vs. poetry vs. pip practical implementation + blog

02. ??
Document pybind setup and explore Python => C/C++ alternatives e.g. ctypes

03. ??
pygame setup and sample => every 3yrs do a new thing

04.
Retro Achievements how to create??

05.
Azure MLOps Hello World example => deploy to cluster
either KinD locally or Azure AKS cluster

Azure MLOps cheat sheet for all the az ml commands


OUTRO
build on 2024 outro
AI, ML, DL, GenAI
already mentioned Healthcare application
extend to specific e.g. Ortho??
2D/3D meshes or other industry?

Main idea tech stack = Python => C/C++ applications
Learning for fun con't OpenAI Retro and Retro cheevos as but both based on libretro


Finally GH CoPilot usage to learn tech quicker
AI Eng = future??
SW Eng apply SOLID principles to apply to AI code = more prod proof
use AI tools e.g. GH C/P to build AI-driven S/W solutions

TODO
can mention MCP servers as part of this integration??


Azure MLOps is an excellent way to transition S/W Eng skills to ML w/o while upskilling on ML
don't have to be expert in ML and models but just know how to deploy and target ML endpoint!!
