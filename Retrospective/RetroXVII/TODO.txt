AI Eng - what skills req'd = future S/W Eng
MLOps => transition ML skills


Achievements
01.
Cloud Setup Cheat Sheet
2024	Provision Kubernetes clusters for GitLab CI/CD pipelines e.g. Azure AKS, AWS-EKS, GCP-GKE
2025	Document DevOps managed clusters provisioning experience with AWS / Azure / GCP providers

04.
Python package mgt uv vs. poetry vs. pip theory learning

05.
Azure MLOps learning: image ACR, env, model, ep, deploy

06.
GitHub Actions learning crash course and ACT to run locally

07.	PyBind resurrection on Mac JetBrains Gateway
Python, C/C++, C#/.NET + Debugging

// don't mention Ortho but generic application

08.
Simpsons Trivia R/A


Objectives
01.
Python package mgt uv vs. poetry vs. pip practical implementation + blog


02.
Azure MLOps Hello World example => deploy to cluster
either KinD locally or Azure AKS cluster

Azure MLOps cheat sheet for all the az ml commands


03. Ach 6 => document next yr
Document pybind setup and explore Python => C/C++ alternatives e.g. ctypes

Explore explore Python => C/C++ alternatives e.g. ctypes
2D / 3D Meshes Linear Algebra C/C++ consumed by Python


04. 
Combine simularity of VS 2022 Windows and CLion on Mac??
//Harness Python potential power invoking C/C++ [PyBind11] with code magnitudes times faster
Extend OpenAI Gym and Retro projects for more Indie video games + Reinforcement Learning!

Retro Achievements how to create??
This final goal combines all the Python + C++ learning from Open AI Gym + Retro + R/A together


XX. 2026	will do PyGame but not mention here!
pygame setup and sample => every 3yrs do a new thing


OUTRO
build on 2024 outro
AI, ML, DL, GenAI

However - twist
a lot of AI Python code is bad - opportunity for prof S/W Eng to productize / commercialize
research projects, prototypes and notebooks to "proper" Professional level code

also get involved in ML OPs !!
great way to transition S/W dev + devOps skills to learn / work w/ ML while get up-to-speed 
on ML models + algorithms

EG
Azure MLOps is an excellent way to transition S/W Eng skills to ML w/o while upskilling on ML
don't have to be expert in ML and models but just know how to deploy and target ML endpoint!!

already mentioned Healthcare application
extend to specific e.g. Ortho??
2D/3D meshes or other industry?

Healthcare -> leverage AI / ML / DL for future learning skillset and future experience
other examples of application...


Main idea tech stack = Python => C/C++ applications
Learning for fun con't OpenAI Retro and Retro cheevos as but both based on libretro

as above ML OPs idea => segue to AI Eng
Finally GH CoPilot usage to learn tech quicker
AI Eng = future??
SW Eng apply SOLID principles to apply to AI code = more prod proof
use AI tools e.g. GH C/P to build AI-driven S/W solutions

TODO
can mention MCP servers as part of this integration?!?
