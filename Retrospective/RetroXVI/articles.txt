AI is the big brain, 
Machine Learning is its learning process, 
Deep Learning is the intricate wiring, and 
Generative AI is the creative spark.



<u>Artificial Intelligence</u><br />
Artificial Intelligence refers to capability of machines to imitate human intelligence.  AI empowers machines to acquire knowledge, adapt and independently make decisions like teaching a computer to act human like.
<br /><br />

<u>Machine Learning</u><br />
AI involves a crucial element known as Machine Learning.  ML is akin to training computers to improve tasks without providing detailed instructions.  Machines utilize data to learn and enhance the performance without explicit programming and concentrates on creating algorithms for computers to learn from data to improve.
<br /><br />

<u>Deep Learning</u><br />
Deep Learning involves artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain: mimicking how human brains work.   DL excels at handling complex tasks and large datasets efficiently and achieves remarkable success in areas like natural language processing and computer vision despite complexity and interpretation challenges.
