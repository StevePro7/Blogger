RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation

In RAG technology, retrieval is a crucial step that directly impacts the quality of the
generated output

However, vector retrieval techniques in base RAG are often insufficient for all scenarios

For instance, traditional retrieval methods tend to perform poorly with large private
document repositories

Many research teams have started incorporating knowledge graphs into RAG to enhance
retrieval accuracy, achieving promising results.

This article explores the principles of knowledge graphs and their application in RAG


Knowledge graph
technical method that uses graph structures to represent and model entities and their
relationships in the real world

Organizes information as nodes [entities] and edges [relationships]
forming an organic netowrk that efficiently stores, queries and analyzes complex
knowledge
