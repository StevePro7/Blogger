<u>Artificial Intelligence</u><br />
<!-- -->
Artificial Intelligence refers to capability of machines to imitate human intelligence.  AI empowers machines to acquire knowledge, adapt and independently make decisions like teaching a computer to act human like.
<br />
<!-- -->
<br />

<u>Machine Learning</u><br />
<!-- -->
AI involves a crucial element known as Machine Learning.  ML is akin to training computers to improve tasks without providing detailed instructions.  Machines utilize data to learn and enhance the performance without explicit programming and concentrates on creating algorithms for computers to learn from data to improve.
<br />
<!-- -->  
<br />

<u>Deep Learning</u><br />
<!-- --> 
Deep Learning involves artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain: mimicking how human brains work.   DL excels at handling complex tasks and large datasets efficiently and achieves remarkable success in areas like natural language processing and computer vision despite complexity and interpretation challenges.
<br />
<!-- --> 
<br />
	
<u>Generative AI</u><br />
<!-- -->
Generative AI is the latest innovation in the AI field.  Instead of just identifying patterns GenAI goes one step further by actually attempting to produce new content that closely resembles what humans might create.

<a href="https://www.snowflake.com/resource/generative-ai-and-llms-for-dummies">Gen AI and LLMs</a> are revolutionizing our personal and professional lives From supercharged digital assistants to seemingly omniscient chatbots these <a href="https://writer.com/guides/generative-ai-survey">technologies</a> are driving a new era of convenience, productivity, and connectivity.
<br /><br />
Traditional AI uses predictive models to classify data, recognize patterns, + predict outcomes within specific context whereas Gen AI models generate entirely new outputs rather than simply making predictions based on prior experience.
<br /><br />
This shift from prediction to creation opens up new realms of innovation: in healthcare traditional predictive model can spot suspicious lesion in lung tissue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">MRI</a> whereas GenAI could also determine the likelihood that patient will develop pneumonia or other lung diseases and offer treatment recommendations based on best practices gleaned from thousands of similar cases.
<br /><br />
<i>Example</i><br />
GenAI powered healthcare chatbots can assist patients and healthcare providers and medical administrators:

<br />
By leveraging conversational AI healthcare chatbot can improve patient engagement and provide real-time support and optimize the workflow for healthcare providers.  Finally, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback RLHF can be integrated to further improve model performance over original pre-trained version!
