Is Your Windows 10 or 11 Time Wrong? http://bit.ly/3yY2UgG Ensure Windows Time service is running! Plus ensure Control Panel | Clock and Region | Date and Time | Internet Time does not error out!

Windows services Time
Automatic

Control Panel | Clock and Region | Date and Time | Internet Time
time.windows.com



but the issue was that Windows time would "eventually" sync
so hopefully I found the issue was that it was Triggered Start


Terminal
sc triggerinfo W32Time delete

restart

and so far so good
i.e. time is sync'd on boot / login
