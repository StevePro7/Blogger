Présentation SMS Power Competition
Révo SEGA 8-bit



"perhaps the single most impressive audo soundtrack the little PSG has ever seen"  


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtaDY79qoK4&t=934s

Lil Evel Knievel
Now this, as they say, is a chonky boy.

With the exception of a couple of very late
era Brazil titles SMS cartridges topped out
at 4 Megabit, or less impressively 512 KB
about 2/3 of one Amiga disk

This, is 8 Megabit or a full Megabyte
It is the same size as the first Mega Drive Sonic game

And here's why
If you're a veteran of this competition
you may remember a non-gaming entry from 2 years ago,
a little demo of the SMS' sound
capabilities using snippets from Van Halen tracks

While technically impressive there was nothing there to actually do
and so unsurprisingly SteveProXNA placed 2nd last beating only a
tile swapping tech demo for the Game Gear

The thing is though, these things often develop to be used in
game and here we are 2 years later with skateboard platformer
Lil Evel Knievel
Because that 1MB is used to give it 
"perhaps the single most impressive audo soundtrack the little PSG has ever seen"  

And I know he's not cheating and using the FM chip for this
because as we already established my Master System doesn't have one

And also because on the title screen it doesn't QUITE work
Yuo don't hear it in the attract loop because the game is pretending to be 
an arcade machine

which often stay silen during those but as soon as you start the game
not only is it using sampled speed and music for its interstitials
as you reach continue points and the end of the level, the ongoing
PSG music is top quality

Just listen to the thing
It's not even the only tune as the game regularly mixes up the music during
the 5 worlds and 10 levels it currently contains with apparent plans for
expansion, although where exactly the room for that is I don't know.

Predicably the music is better than the game itself and certainly more comprehensive
Evel K is a very simple mobile style runner if it's anything featuring just long and
short jumps in a constantly scrolling level 

The difficulty is done clever, making the game more difficult changes nothing except
moving you further right on the screen so you have less time to react which is a 
neat if cheap way to solve that problem

There are some problems with it as a concept
Because you can only see fo far ahead, whatever the difficulty, there are times where
you have to make a blind decision on which size of jump to use as the long one can see
you sailing into the middle distance as the platform you were supposed to land on
runs out.

The general rule of thumb is if you can see the landing point at the last minute then
can use the short jump but that doesn't quite seem to be a hard and fast rule

Still though, this is an experience game and is one of the pleasingly large number
of times in this competition where we're discovering games that genuinely get more
out of the machine than anything did in its entire commercial life

Music as I said earlier is often the thing that's easy to neglect in a time pressure
competition entry game and to have 2 FM sound chip games and something doing this 
much clever in this year's competition is great.

I'm judging by how much fun the game is in this list and Evel is not the best thing
I've played this year but it might just be the cleverest and especially if you've
got a real Mazzy Sazzy handy you have got to give this a go to hear it for yourself.



Great video @Dudley - thanks for taking such an interest in SMS Homebrew and awesome feedback about Lil Evel Knievel esp. the audio sound track
PS: hit button 1 or 2 after jumping Lil EK into the air to pull off some cool flips n' trick combos :)
