<u>Sprites</u><br />
The Title screen uses <a href="https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS/blob/master/SMSlib/src/SMSlib.h#L58">Zoom</a> sprites in which the 24x32 player sprite is magnified as a 48x64 sprite.  However, SMS I has a <a href="https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS/wiki/Advanced">bug</a> in how the VDP processes zoomed sprites.   Therefore, to circumvent the VDP bug you have to draw 4x additional sprites on the same Y coordinates of the original sprites to be displayed.  For example:

{
	engine_sprite_manager_mode( idx, mode, x - 8, y );

	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 0, y + mode * 0 );
	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 8, y + mode * 0 );
	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 192, y + mode * 0 );

	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 0, y + mode * 16 );
	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 8, y + mode * 16 );
	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 192, y + mode * 16 );
	engine_sprite_manager_zoom( mode, 224, y + mode * 16 );

BUG on SMS #1

Then to circumvent the VDP 'bug' you have to place 4 additional sprites on the same Y coordinates of the sprites you want to display. These 4 additional sprites can be transparent, placed at any X coordinate, or they could simply be placed at X=0 in case you're hiding the leftmost BG column... they won't appear.
