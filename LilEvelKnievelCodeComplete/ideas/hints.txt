Visibility descreases as difficult increases: Easier, Normal, Harder, Insane
there are four difficulties:
 
if you see repeat single turtle then Leap or Hurl coming up

opt for Hurl and move opposite direction to ensure invert somersault lands OK

down to accelerate land so don't overshoot target

prefer Hurl for long slow cruzy somersaults or rapid multiple somersaults tricks

get inventive and combine 

jump and flip will never die
