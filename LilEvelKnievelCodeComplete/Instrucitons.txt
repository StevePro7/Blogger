<u>Instructions</u><br />
Lil Evel Knievel V1.0 game play is very open and simple due to the aggressive coding competition deadline: jump over varying platform gaps and pull off cool skateboard flips and trick combos to complete each level.
<br /><br />  
There are four jump categories on ground: Skip, Jump, Leap, Hurl.  Once airborne Lil EK can swap direction or flip somersault.  Move opposite direction while airborne inverts somersault and down to accelerate land.
