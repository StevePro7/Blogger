Command
28-Apr-2023


The Command design pattern encapsulates a command request as an object.  In game code, an example of a command request could be a move command: e.g. move sprite left, right or jump command flip, swap etc.

Coindentally, Lil EK uses 8x commands [plus default no command] therefore each command stored as a single bit thus all 8x can be stored in a single byte

This way, combinations of commands such as jump and right can be bitwised detected and recorded for playback.  This process is critical for development and esp. debugging as streams of commands can be issued to the game engine and any combination of game play action and physics collision detection can be "detected" to ensure the game engine source code is rock solid and bug free
