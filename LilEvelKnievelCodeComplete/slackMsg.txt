A lot of people believe that collaboration is the future of software [including me :)].

Outside work, I have been jamming with some of the hottest coders on the planet on the Indie scene
from the Sega Facebook group to SMSPower! and contributing on open source projects like
sdcc and devkitSMS.

As a result, I would like to share my latest video game creation built for the Sega Master System
"Lil Evel Knievel"
with help from all these communities

Grab a free copy of the official game ROM here.
and play on an emulation: either Emulicious or Fusion is popular
or simply watch the long play video, trailer, or this in-depth analysis of the game.

For the geeks: game is written in pure C [some inline assembly code]
Source code found here

Features:

Enjoy!
Oh, and "Catch you on the flip side dude meisters!"


digitized speech
parallax scrolling
command design pattern
[record + playback demo mode]
ROM hacking
zoom sprites
