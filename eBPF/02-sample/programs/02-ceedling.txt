IMPORTANT
makes reference to  Ceedling Test Explorer extension which I installed but could not get this line of code working
"program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/test/out/${command:ceedlingExplorer.debugTestExecutable}",
            "args": [],

so just hardcoded to test_container.

test_shape_container.out
