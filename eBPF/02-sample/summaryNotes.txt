However, low level systems application programming like eBPF, in Linux, is perhaps one of the very few development experiences available in modern day professional Software Engineering that it's similar in stature! Therefore, I believe this is something definitely worth investigating more in the coming year J

Summary
To summarize, Go is now popular due to its ability to deliver highly scalable concurrent computing software. Plus, Cgo also allows Go programs to interoperate with C libraries, distributed cloud computing, and eBPF.

Therefore, writing low level C code to target 8-bit Sega Master System hardware and 16-bit Sega Mega Drive has proved to be very valuable experience for Cgo applications which could assist in Go + Cloud Computing!

Another example eBPF: a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed C programs safely and efficiently extending the capabilities of the Linux kernel, without requiring changes to kernel source code or load kernel modules, consumed from Go packages providing high-performance networking in cloud native environments.
