Issue today as there was a Sky update overnight
Sky mini box bedroom - No satellite signal
However main Sky box working OK
tl;dr
Sky mini box was attempting to update
but main box should do the update OK

Main sky box
Settings | System Info | Software Version | Setup
Update
NB: can still use the main Sky box while update
you see the Q on the Sky Q blue = downloading update
its up to you to go back to Setup to see download complete
Sky will complete the Software Update next time box goes on standby

Switch main Sky box off at wall = reset = complete Software update
Go back into bedroom and Sky mini now sync'd = all resolved

When Sky wants to update the software then the reset process can be painful
But after 2hrs today I figured what was wrong

Basically the main Sky Q box in the den needs to be updated
When an update happens on the main Sky Q box then sometimes the Internet needs to be re-connected again

Main menu
Settings
Network connection
Reset if necessary
Find the WiFi and re-enter password


Extra Sky Q box in bedroom
the Sky software update needs to occur again but it may not be able to re-connect to the WiFi
until the step is complete

I saw that extra box kept failing to connect to the internet because the main box needed to re-connect to the WiFi
after the udpate was complete



Other things that may go pear shaped


Need to re-pair the remote control

Press + hold 7+9 and remote will flash 4x times
Press + hold 1+3 and remote will flash 2x times

then you need to go thru the wizard
TV
TCL
model	find it for me

Press volume and check	Yes

when prompted for the speaker control	press No
so that the volume will work on the main remote	plus the TV remote


Finally when the extra box is re-activating after the SW update you may need to pair the extra box to the main box
the wizard will go thru 4x steps and on 2 of 4 you will have to press and hold the RHS button on the MAIN SkyQ box
this pairs the 2x boxes

Step 3 of 4 will try to find IP address	if this doesn't work then ensure main Sky box Setings Network is connected to the Internet!
I found the network was Y but the Internet was N so after reset Internet on main box to Y then the extra box moved to step 4 of 4

Setp 4 of 4 will complete
now the Sky Q box is activated

NB: extra channels everything thru the main box over WiFi
