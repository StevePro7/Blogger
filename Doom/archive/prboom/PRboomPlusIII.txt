google prboom.wad file
as latest build was complaining about lumps in wad
e.g.
CRBRICK

therefore after googling found this repo at libretro

https://github.com/libretro/libretro-prboom/blob/master/prboom.wad

attempt to rpelicate pr-boom on libretro-prboom
https://github.com/libretro/libretro-prboom

but got similar other errors i.e. lumps on wad file
but this time was 
PAYPAL??
