<u>Summary</u></br />
To summarize, we have now setup Doom ports on both Windows and Linux computers to debug step through and better understand the source code.  While this has been a fun and nostalgic exercise, many believe that this is crucial that Software Developers should <a href="https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2019/05/06/programmers-lets-study-source-code-classics">review</a> influential source code: rather than repeat the same past mistakes, we should study great works that preceded us and learn from and build upon their lessons.
<br /><br />
Another motivation to study classic video game source code is their relevance to modern day AI topics such as Reinforcement Learning.  For example: VizDoom allows developing AI bots to play Doom using only visual information.  Hosted by The Farama Foundation, VizDoom allows creating environments based on the Doom engine.  The library provides Python API wrappers for the Gymnasium / OpenAI Gym interface and provides an excellent opportunity to research machine visual learning and deep reinforcement learning in the future!

It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.
