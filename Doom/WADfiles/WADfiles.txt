WAD files

I got doom2 working but seems you MUST have the doom2.wad file
based at the SD root folder; just having in game folder won't work
and you get the "W_InitFiles: no files found" error


Today, I tried to run @krikzz version of Doom on Sega Mega Drive
but was detecting Public DOOM so I tried to download some WAD files
