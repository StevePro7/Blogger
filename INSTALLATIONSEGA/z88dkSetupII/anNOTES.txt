z88dk Setup II
12/10/2019

2wk ago I re-setup z88dk with Galactic Revenge built
1wk ago I ran some local test code samples built

The process was very simple this time compare to last

If you followed this blog then you will have
C:\z88dk

and cmd prompt zcc with result in 
version 2.5.7

Therefore remove or rename e.g. C:\z88dk_old

Navigate here
https://sourceforge.net/projects/z88dk/files/z88dk

Download latest version - at the time of this writing is 1.99C
https://sourceforge.net/projects/z88dk/files/z88dk/1.99C/z88dk-win32-1.99C.zip/download

Unzip to C:\z88dk
Add following directory C:\z88dk\bin to $PATH

Example
C:\Steven\Personal\INSTALLATIONSEGA\z88dk_code02\anTEST


Not sure how devkit works
e.g.
#include "SMSlib.h"
#include "PSGlib.h"

as cannot see any linking to the SMSlib.lib static lib or PSGlib.rel
only <arch>

TODO
may have to understand how this works but anyway does magically work


Need to go thru the entire examples e.g. CandyKidDemoSMS
graphics tiles
sprite tiles
sound effect
music songs
input detection
pause menu

to ensure all of this would work in order to build game
in theory would have all the game code + banks etc.
but just swap out 2x build scripts
sdcc
zcc


Finally, I always use folder2c but I understand assets2banks replacing this
Could have an example of this for completeness
