z88dk Setup II
12/10/2019

TODO
Must give blurb how initially z88dk had compiler zcc plus own devkit to write code in C to target various platforms including Sega Master System [SMS]
Wrote 3D City using this and worked OK but only in the emulator on PC - did not work on real SMS hardware

Therefore, after using Galactic Revenge source code as an example, we now built program using devkitSMS but compile using zcc [not sdcc]
Let's check it out

NB: I was fortunate enough to have eruiz share the source code for GR including build scripts etc. to understand how this all works
I don't believe the source code is available publicly so you may have to ask for it personally


02.
other todo task is to re-write my way and publish on github but would have to ask for permission...!


Now we want to use the example to build C programs for SMS using devkitSMS but compile using zcc
Must setup first...
