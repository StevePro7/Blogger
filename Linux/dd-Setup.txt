<u>Setup</u><br />
This section assumes Ubuntu Linux is installed irrespective of the platform.  Now, let's do some basic setup:  Login and verify an Internet connection: Settings (top right hand side) | System Settings | Network | Wired.
<br /><br />

<b>Resolution</b><br />
Typically, the initial display will not max out monitor resolution so let's fix that:  Show Applications (bottom right) | Settings | Display.  Choose resolution that makes sense for monitor size.  Use Landscape orientation.  In VirtualBox, View menu.  Choose Scaled Mode.  Drag screen borders to maximize remaining monitor space.
<br /><br />

<b>Keyboard</b><br />
Settings | Region & Language.  Choose Language English (US) and Format for keyboard layout that you like.  Also, you may <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/131900/how-do-i-switch-the-command-key-and-control-key-on-a-macbook-pro">switch</a> the Command and Control key if you are on a Mac for consistency.  Launch Terminal:

key <LCTL> {    [ Super_L       ]   };
key <LWIN> {    [ Control_L     ]   };
key <RCTL> {    [ Super_R       ]   };
key <RWIN> {    [ Control_R     ]   };
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*
</pre> 
<br />

<b>Shortcuts</b><br />
Following Keyboard, update <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/546669/copy-and-paste-doesnt-work-in-terminal">Terminal</a> keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste consistency.

Remove any unwanted applications from Favorites.  Add any new applications to Favorites accordingly.  E.g.: Show Applications | Search "Terminal".  Double Terminal to launch.  Right click Terminal | Add to Favorites.
<br /><br />

<b>Folder Share</b><br />
In order to share files between the host and virtual machine enable folder share:  Show Applications | Files | Other Locations.  Connect to Server "smb://host-pc" | Connect.  Enter Windows Username and Password and WORKGROUP for Domain.  Otherwise, choose Domain as the Local Area Network [LAN] domain accordingly.
<br /><br />
