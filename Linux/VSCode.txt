Ubuntu Linux VS Code - the window is not responding

On Ubuntu Linux with VS Code, a "window is not responding" freeze is usually caused by
GPU acceleration, a stuck extension, or a hung Electron process.

e.g.
I am now logging on to Ubuntu using GPU accelerated kernel 5.15
nvidia-smi


Therefore launch VS Code without GPU acceleration

pkill -f code
code --disable-gpu
