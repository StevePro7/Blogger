SETUP
Ensure that I find the JSON blob that switches Ctrl + Command keys so I can have consistent Ctrl+C e.g. on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux


Hyper-V Manager
follow instructions from blog post and make sure everything works OK
and there is nothing outstanding

Also in the HyperV txt file there is some reference to Enhanced Session Mode
from memory this is due to HyperV running slow so the mode "speeds" things up
Although, I couldn't really get this running and was always slow for me!
