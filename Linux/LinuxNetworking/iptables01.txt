Iptables REDIRECT vs. DNAT vs. TPROXY
https://gsoc-blog.ecklm.com/iptables-redirect-vs.-dnat-vs.-tproxy

iptables --table nat --append PREROUTING --protocol tcp --dport 80 --jump DNAT     --to-destination 10.0.4.2

iptables --table nat --append PREROUTING --protocol tcp --dport 80 --jump REDIRECT --to-destination 10.0.4.2


TPROXY
Proxies are nodes / software that are used to stand between the client and the service
the client connects to the proxy server which then connects to the server thru a distinct connection

A transparent proxy [TPROXY] is invisible for the client

A Deep Dive into Iptables and Netfilter Architecture
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-deep-dive-into-iptables-and-netfilter-architecture

iptables is a widely used firewall tool that interfaces with the kernel netfilter packet filtering framework


iptables
basic firewall sortware most commonly used in Linux
interact with packet filtering hooks in Linux kernel networking stack


netfilter
kernel [packet filtering] hooks 


kmod
kernel modules associated with iptables register at these [netfilter] hooks
to ensure traffic confirms to conditions latid out by the firewall rules



Netfilter hooks
5x
NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING
NF_IP_LOCAL_IN
NF_IP_FORWARD
NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT
NF_IP_POST_ROUTING


iptables firewall uses tables to organize its rules
tables classify rules by type of decision e.g. nat, filter tables

iptables rules in each table organized by chains

chains
represent which netfilter hooks to trigger
determine when rules will be evaluated


chain			hook
PREROUTING	chain	Triggered by the NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hook
INPUT		chain	Triggered by the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN hook
FORWARD		chain	Triggered by the NF_IP_FORWARD hook
OUTPUT		chain	Triggered by the NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT hook
POSTROUTING	chain	Triggered by the NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hook
