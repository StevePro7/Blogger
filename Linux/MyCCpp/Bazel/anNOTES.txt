Driver
trying to build envoy from source
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\Blogger\Cloud\Envoy


Tutorial
https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/tutorial/cpp.html


GitHub example
git clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples


Common C++ Build Use Cases
https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/cpp-use-cases.html



WORKSPACE
Workspace directory
holds project's source files and Bazel's build outputs

BUILD
tells Bazel how to build different parts of the project


Package
directory w/in workspace tha tcontains a BUILD file


directory = Bazel workspace
create empty WORKSPACE file


Understand the BUILD file
build rule
tells Bazel how to build the desired outputs
e.g.
exe
lib


Target
each instance of a build rule in the BUILD file



EXAMPLE

Stage1
cd /home/stevepro/GitHubX/bazelbuild/examples/cpp-tutorial/stage1
bazel build //main:hello-world


target label
//main:
i.e.
location of BUILD file relative to WORKSPACE

hello-world
target name in BUILD file


bazel build //main:hello-world

OUTPUT
/home/stevepro/GitHubX/bazelbuild/examples/cpp-tutorial/stage1/bazel-bin


Test binary
bazel-bin/main/hello-world


Review the dependency graph
bazel query --notool_deps --noimplicit_deps "deps(//main:hello-world)" --output graph

if get this error then kill the process
e.g.
