Linux
launch VS Code
main.cpp

Build
Ctrl+Shift+B

Run
F5
debug


IMPORTANT
originally in launch.json I set the value of miDebuggerPath
"miDebuggerPath": "/bin/gdb"

but I got the error 
Unable to start debugging.  The value of miDebuggerPath is invalid


found solution / workaround

Reference:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56344186/unable-to-start-debugging-the-value-of-midebuggerpath-is-invalid

launch terminal
whereis gdb
gdb: /usr/bin/gdb /etc/gdb /usr/share/gdb /opt/clion-2021.1.3/bin/gdb /usr/share/man/man1/gdb.1.gz


Therefore updated launch.json
"miDebuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb"


and now worked OK
