VS Code extensions
12/08/2021

Launch VS Code
Install the following extensions

C/C++
C++ Intellisense
C/C++ Compile Run




C/C++ Compile Run
write code
set break points
F5	debug step thru code
Ctrl+F5	debug step thru code
VS Code says that Ctrl+F5 should Run without Debugging
but this is currently a bug
VS Code v1.59.0

However, install extension
C/C++ Compile Run
F6 	run without debugging
and is lightning quick
