Desktop Failed
29/09/2023

Today I was doing some Python in PyCharm on Linux but I could not setup a virtualenv
I got an error in PyCharm that complained about
virtualenv.seed.app

something
so I followed some blog which prompted me to uninstall some virtualenv stuff
sudo apt-remote 
tl;dr
AFter remoot I couldn't login to Ubuntu desktop
error
Failed to start session

I believe the problem with removing some Python modules or something must have caused this

SOLUTION
reinstall ubuntu-desktop

Reference
https://itsfoss.com/failed-to-start-session-ubuntu-14-04

Method
reboot
choose option1
reboot from recovery mode
choose latest version

popup
do not choose option1 = black screen of death

choose others
choose network configuration
otherwise sudo apt-get update will throw errors

choose root
follow instructinos in post
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop

IMPORTANT
I will be get prompted that there are multiple display managers
because I installed lightdm after to avail of VNC Viewer

choose lightdm
sudo reboot


Now on reboot prior screen was blue is now black again
and can login as before - yah!
