Had A LOT of issues trying to ping Linux host from Windows host

Gateway		192.168.15.1

Windows PC	192.168.15.41
Linux Host	192.168.15.50

Windows
ping 192.168.15.50

tries to resolve to Windows host 192.168.15.40
but with

Destination host unreachable


Thus VNC View cannot connect


Chat GPT
Windows 10 ping 192.168.15.50 destination host unreachable


Finally this seemed to work

Windows
cmd
Run as Administrator

netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

ping 192.168.15.50
Reply!!

netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
ping 192.168.15.50
