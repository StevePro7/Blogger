I installed Ubuntu on Virtual Box on my iMac last week
I accept the default Irish keyboard
Now I need to setup keyboard, set video resolution to 2560x1440
I need to install all the relevant software

Follow Notes first


01.
Change resolution first
Settings | System Settings | Display
Resolution 1920 x 1440 (4:3)
I didn't see 256x1440 but I did see 2560 x 1600
Apply

Set the Mac dock to left to maximise virtual box height


02.
Setup share folder

Connect to Server

but this didn't work for 2560x1440 so revert back to 1920 x 1440


03.
Accept all defaults which means install Irish keyboard
Remove

Settings
Text Entry
Irish
Remove
ensure that English (US) is the only keyboard as this uses "@"


03b.
Disable lock screen
Start the application "Settings"
Choose "Privacy" under the "Personal" heading.
Choose "Screen Lock"
Toggle "Automatic Screen Lock" from the default "ON" to "OFF"


04.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geany-dev/ppa
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install geany geany-plugins-common


IMPORTANT
Not sure what I did but the resolution of the virtual box ubuntu is max'd out
Actually some how managed to do this:

01.
VM | View | Scale mode
When Virtual Box launches Ubuntu there is a prompt
The virtual machine window will beg now switched to Scale mode
You can go back to windowed mode at any time by pressing Host+C

02.
The keyboard Ctrl seems to be swapped for Windows [cmd] not sure how

SOLUTION
https://askubuntu.com/questions/131900/how-do-i-switch-the-command-key-and-control-key-on-a-macbook-pro

key <LCTL> {    [ Super_L       ]   };
key <LWIN> {    [ Control_L     ]   };

...

key <RCTL> {    [ Super_R       ]   };
key <RWIN> {    [ Control_R     ]   };


sudo rm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*
Restart
