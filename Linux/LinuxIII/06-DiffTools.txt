After using WinMerge on Windows for years I would like to try alternative for Linux

I installed via the Ubuntu Software installer

- Meld
- KDiff3

both have different method to compare directory structure


Meld
New comparison
File comparison		LHS
Directory comparison	RHS


KDiff3
a bit more intuitive
A			LHS
B			RHS
C	optional	used for 3-way merge I guess
