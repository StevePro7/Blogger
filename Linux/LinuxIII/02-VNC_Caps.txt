02-VNC CAPS LOCK
31/07/2021


Every now and again I get Caps lock automatically on VNC Viewer
remote Linux box e.g. laptop


Not sure 100% how I got this "fixed" today but this helped

On screen keyboard


Settings
Universal Access
Typing | Screen Keyboard	ENABLED

top left
Bounce Keys			ENABLED
Mouse  Keys			ENABLED


Launch gedit
start typing
Onscreen keyboard pops up
Hit ?123			toggle to numbers
"mess" around
ABC				toggle to letters
con't typing
magically toggles Upper case letters to lower case??
