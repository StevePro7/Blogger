IMPORTANT
I hit key shortcut and got black screen of death again today
e.g.
GoLand | Ctrl + Alt + F12

so I went to repeat steps below but I got error doing this:
e.g.
login as recovery mode
prompt
OK	top	OK
login

Terminal
sudo su
cd Downloads
./NVIDIA...run


ERROR
you appear to be running an x server


SOLUTION
https://askubuntu.com/questions/149206/how-to-install-nvidia-run


What the problem is that I use lightdm for VNC Viewer [I think]
so much drop down to terminal in Recovery mode and re-install manually

reboot in Recovery Mode

prompt
OK	top	OK
login

stevepro
SP4
sudo service lightdm stop
sudo init 3
./NVIDIA...run
sudo service lightdm start


NOTE
would have to repeat these steps on each kernel update
sudo reboot

Finally, ensure that Additional Drivers set to manually
e.g.
Additional Drivers tab
NVIDIA
Continue using a manually installed driver


I *believe* I have to do this going forward as I replaced GNOME with lightdm
in order to be able to use the VNC Viewer so continue using this config for now



24/06/2021
Go to Computer Dr
login as recovery mode
prompt
continue

sudo su
~/Downloads
./NVidia.run

Start | Additional drivers
ensure that NVidia is manual

also if this happens again then reboot in recovery mode
change to Xorg Xserver
install graphics driver
reboot



Recovery mode
Ubuntu 20.04 has experienced an error

rm -r /var/crash/*
