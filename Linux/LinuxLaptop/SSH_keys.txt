SSH keys
22-Aug-2024

I have 2x SSH id_rsa public / private key pairs setup on Linux
StevePro7
SteveProXNA

However, today for some reasono when I switched t SteveProXNA
I was constantly prompted to enter password 124Pwd

This seemed to work

Copy SteveProXNA keys over to ~/.ssh
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub

Terminal
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Enter passphrase for /home/stevepro/.ssh/id_rsa:
P4
Identity added: /home/stevepro/.ssh/id_rsa (steven_boland@hotmail.com)
