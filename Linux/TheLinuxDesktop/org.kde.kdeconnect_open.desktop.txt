org.kde.kdeconnect_open.desktop
19-Jan-2024

Today I tried to install K8s Studio on Ubuntu Linux but got an error 
complaining about this file and the MIME type


org.kde.kdeconnect_open.desktop
cd /usr/share/applications


Suggestion
https://github.com/clearlinux/distribution/issues/1906


Change this line from this to this
MimeType=*/*;
MimeType=application/octet-stream;


IMPORTANT
I made a back up of this file just-in-case I need to revert!
