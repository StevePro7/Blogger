<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/search/label/Candy%20Kid">Candy Kid</a> has had a very interesting journey after first appearing on the Sega <a href="http://www.smspower.org/Scans/SegaComputer-Magazine-Issue02?gallerypage=17">SC-3000</a> in 1984 to being ported to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/StevePro-Studios-Retro-Candy-Download/dp/B018WIUDZ8/qid=1449745287">Windows</a> PC, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/retro-candy-kid/id1055478836">iOS</a> + <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steveproxna.candykid">Android</a> in 2015 and finally the Sega <a href="https://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/CandyKid-SMS">Master System</a> in 2020.
<br /><br />


In fact, after porting the original game in 2015 the ultimate <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2015/05/candy-kid-video-game.html">goal</a> was always to eventually back port Candy Kid to the Master System.  Thanks to the awesome Indie game dev scene this goal has now been achieved!
