Now prefers to use OAth to connect Source Tree with github.com
to automate code being pushed

i.e.
not store password in URL .git/config
https://github.com/StevePro7/FlickySMS.git


must connect Source Tree to github.com
I had issue on the Mac

so I tried
Preferences
Accounts

Add
OAth
StevePro7
Connect
browser prompts to open Source Tree
but when I push I get 403 authorization error

In the end I simply removed the account
Push

prompt to enter password for StevePro7
Pwd124

now everything OK and automate works fine
