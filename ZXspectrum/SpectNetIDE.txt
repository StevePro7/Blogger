E:\Steven\INSTALLATION\VisualStudio



https://dotneteer.github.io/spectnetide/getting-started/install-spectnetide.html


Installed Spect.Net.VsPackage.vsix
However only saw 2x ZX Spec options in
VS2017
VS2019

Launch VS2019
Extensions | Manage extensions
search for spec

Reference
https://dotneteer.github.io/spectnetide/getting-started/install-spectnetide-2#article

Saw option for
SpecNetIde 2.0
so download and install this

I think V2 is only available for VS2019
Yes as is only preview

Therefore 
install V1 for both 2017 + 2019
install V2 for only 2019
uninstall V1 for 2017

Good move otherwise under Extensions menu you get double the ZX Spectrum stuff
