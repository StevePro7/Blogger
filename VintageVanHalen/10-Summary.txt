<u>Summary</u><br />
Vintage Van Halen is the first 16-bit project ever built by StevePro Studios for the Sega MegaDrive / Genesis.  Fortunately, like Sega Master System, the MegaDrive community provides fantastic online help and support.
<br /><br />
Finally, after years of developing for the Sega Master System, it was seamless to apply many developmental ideas acquired from 8-bit development to 16-bit thus the project was completed in a short time.  Awesome!
