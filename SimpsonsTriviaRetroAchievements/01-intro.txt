In 2018, Simpsons Trivia built for the Sega Master System was one entry in the annual SMS Power! Coding competition.  The immediate forum feedback super positive.  In 2020, member FeRcHuLeS posted enjoyment of the game and mastered on retroachievements.org.  I was unaware of this website so I had to investigate!

Thanks FeRcHuLeS for the update: I found the website that you are referring to https://retroachievements.org/game/14672

Wow - amazing...! I had no idea about this so I downloaded and set up the RALibRetro emulator and started playing Simpsons Trivia again trying to get my own achievements posted :)
