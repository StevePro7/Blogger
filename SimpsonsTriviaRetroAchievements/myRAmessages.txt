RA messages
20-Oct-2025


we have special emulators that let you view the games RAM, a developer looks through that RAM and tries to figure out what each location is used for and then put them together in a way that ensures the player did what he was supposed to. Our integration looks through those conditions every frame and when they're all considered true you get a popup showing that you've earned the achievement while the emulator sends the site a message to unlock the achievement for you and add points to your account


0xDifficulty == 0 <br />
0xSelected Rounds == 0<br />
0xCorrect Answers == 5<br />
0xScreen ID == C (values in memory are almost always in Hex)


makes perfect sense and actually as game is pretty simple I quickly realized that all the logic to award an achievement was done at the Game Over screen, which of course is screen ID 0x0C [12] as in the source code posted on Github<br />
