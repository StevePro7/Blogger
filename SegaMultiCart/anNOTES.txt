I had a ZX81 version of moon patrol which, when I look at it now, I wonder how anyone could get it to work with a machine code scroll routine stored in a REM and not explanation of that. Also I did a series on Z80 assembly language, there's one of those in there too. I was 17 at the time so consider that mitigating circumstances... Trying to redeem myself with a colour-matching 2.5d shoot 'em up for PC (screenshot), hopefully out on Steam later this year. The proceeds of my writings for Computer Input got me my SC3000 so was pretty pleased with myself at the time.


Thanks very much Shayne Burbery for this link... I had no idea about the Computer Input magazine!  Awesome job on the articles esp. Moon Patrol - I remember Jet Ranger in Sega Sept/Oct 1985 mag had REM statements and machine code listed but I think your listing only has the POKEd REM statements but can't seem to see any source machine code?!?  I always wondered how the "older" guys growing up already knew Z80 assembly by the time the Sega SC-3000 came along... I'm guessing everyone cut their teeth on the ZX micro computers first :)
