Currenlty, Android 10.0 (Q) is available although this API level 29 seems to be missing from Visual Studio Tools menu | Android | Android SDK Manager.  However, here is a workaround to circumvent the problem:
<br /><br />

Launch Android Studio.  Install Android 10 (API level 29) as above.  Ensure <i>android-29</i> exists in Android SDK "platforms" folder and <i>29.0.2</i> in "build-tools".  Launch Visual Studio 2019.  Update Android version in project:

In fact, VS2019 does <b>not</b> have MonoGame project templates.  Therefore, the cleanest approach may be to create new MonoGame Project in VS2017.  Build + run to device.  Close, re-open + con't project in VS2019!
