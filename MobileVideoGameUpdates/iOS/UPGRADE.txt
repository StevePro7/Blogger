Pipeline
do this first as is common to both Android and iOS


ANDROID
Upgrade
At the time of this writing VS2019 does not have MonoGame project templates setup.

Therefore, it may be easiest to launch VS2017.  Create new MonoGame Android project.
Close VS2017 and open project in VS2019.

Re-import all code and update Content as per Pipeline section

Going forward, open MonoGame Android project in VS2019...


iOS
Upgrade
At the time of this writing VS2019 does not have MonoGame project templates setup.

Therefore, it may be easiest to launch VS2017.  Create new MonoGame iOS project.

IMPORTANT
Previously next step would be "Pair PC to Mac".  
However, after upgrading all software VS2017 may prompt Mono Mismatch

DO NOT click install here because doing so will cause Visual Studio for Mac to prompt Mono Framework MDK 

Instead Close VS2017 and open project in VS2019.

The first time you may be prompted Xamarin iOS mismatch - if this is the case then upgrade accordinlgy.

Re-import all code and update Content as per Pipeline section

Going forward, open MonoGame iOS project in VS2019...
