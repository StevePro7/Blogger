ERROR Tue, 5th Nov 2019
08/11/2019

I think I know what is going on RE: latest error:
Mon 4th Nov	CK Prod
Tue 5th Nov	3D City
I uploaded these 2x OK
but CK Free didn't upload because of the AppIcon issue
then after I updated that I got the error on upload

So I downgraded Visual Studio for Mac to match the current version of Xamarin iOS
13.6.0.12

Now both Windows and Mac match but no matter what I tried it wouldn't upload
I tried the Application Loader and still no joy

Fri, 8th Nov
I saw in VS2019 that you can right click | Archive and have option to save IPA
on VS for Mac don't have this option anymore
so I tried that - save Distribution version of IPA, copy to Mac and try to upload via Application Loader

Here is where I got the second error msg which gave more info and "seems" to have solved the puzzle
Xcode 11.2 builds deprecated Tue 5th Nov which is when I saw the error the very next day!  Wed 6th Nov

Fortunately the solution should be to upgrade Xcode to 11.2.1 and retry
NB: I may need to get compatible version of Xamarin iOS...??
