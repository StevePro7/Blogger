<br /><br />

<i>Data</i><br />
Import any ASCII text files or XML configuration files.  Set the Build Action in the Properties section to Copy.
<br /><br />

Typically import pre-built XNB binary files from previous games e.g. Emulogic.xnb.  Set Build Action to Copy.
<br /><br />

<u>Pipeline</u><br />
Previous posts used older versions of MonoGame which meant the Content Pipeline was arguably not built correctly.  Upgrade to MonoGame 3.7 and build the Content Pipeline correctly using the Content.mgcb file.
