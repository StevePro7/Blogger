Then mention about Samsung S10
how have to install Android 10.0 (Q) thru Android Studio first
but will dump the stuff to correct location as aligned Android SDK path

but must open MonoGame Android project in Visual Studio 2019
Right click project | Properties

change value to Android 10.0 (Q) - cannot do this in VS2017


Finally, cannot currently create new MonoGame Android project in Visual Studio 2019 
as there is currently no project template... must create in VS2017 and open in VS2019 if would like to target Android 10.0 (Q)
