May have to upgrade CSproj file also esp. if Content rebuild does not create "Content" folder
e.g.
bin/iOS/Content/*
		
Alternatively, create new MonoGame project using 3.7.1 latest build
then port all old code across to new project and build this way

Why?
Because Content may *NOT* build correctly
${Platform}/Content
