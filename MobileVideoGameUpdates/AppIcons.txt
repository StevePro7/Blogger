AppIcons

SORTED out why I could not see App icon on "desktop" for fresh build:

In the old days I had all the App Icons under the Resources folder
but this is not correct - maybe it was the old way of doing things


However, must put the AppIcons beneath Assets.xcassets folder under the root
But there seems to be inconsistency between Windows + Mac

When you create new MonoGame iOS project ther eis no AppIcon folder
but when you open the Info.plist file you can choose "Migrate to Asset Catalog"

However, there seems to be inconsistency between Windows + Mac:
Windows creates "Media.xcassets" parent folder for the AppIcon.appiconset
MacOS/X creates "Assets.xcassets" parent folder for the AppIcon.appiconset

Therefore, it seems to be the best thing to do this:
Create new MG iOS project on Windows in VS2017
Do not pair to Mac
Close VS2017
Check in basic project files setup
Open in Visual Studio for Mac
Launch Info.plist
iPhone Icons
click "Migrate to Assets Catalog"
this action will create Assets.xcassets beneather the root folder
By default it will take the GameThumbnail.png file and move into AppIcon.appiconset sub-folder beneath Assets.xcassets 
Check in
Open in VS2019
continue import code + content

Note: if you'd like to change the name of the default GameThumbnail.png file to something like Icon.png
then open Contents.json in AppIcon.appiconset and change name to the GameThumbnail.png to Icon.png here

IMPORTANT
If you choose to open Info.plist in VS2019 and ""Migrate to Assets Catalog" in the Visual Assets tab then VS2019 will create "Media.xcassets" NOT "Assets.xcassets" which may cause issue when you archive the iOS build on the Mac.  By following the order above then this workaround should display the app icon when built on either Windows or Mac to iOS device.
