QUESTIONS
Export Compliance
Have you added or made changes to encryption features since your last submission of this app?
Export laws require that products containing encryption must be properly authorized for export. Failure to comply could result in severe penalties. Learn more about export requirements.

No
Advertising Identifier
Does this app use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA)?
The Advertising Identifier (IDFA) is a unique ID for each iOS device and is the only way to offer targeted ads. Users can choose to limit ad targeting on their iOS device.

Ensure that you select the correct answer for Advertising Identifier (IDFA) usage. If your app does contain the IDFA and you select No, the binary will be permanently rejected and you will have to submit a different binary.
