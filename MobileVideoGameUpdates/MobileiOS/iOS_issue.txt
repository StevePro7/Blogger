MonoGame issue on iOS
http://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-ios-idictionary-byte-t-crash/11952


On iOS, the latest version of MonoGame 3.7.1
there seems to be an issue with the following code that worked OK on previous versions of MonoGame

<pre class="csharp" name="code">
IDictionary<Byte, Vector2> BoardBasePositions { get; }
IDictionary<Byte, Rectangle> BoardRectangles { get; }

Vector2 position = BoardBasePositions[key];

public void Init()
{
  BoardBasePositions = new Dictionary<Int16, Vector2>();
  BoardRectangles = new Dictionary<Int16, Rectangle>();

  // hydrate the collections...
}

private Vector2 GetVector2(Byte key)
{
  // CRASH..!!
  return BoardBasePositions[key];
}

</pre>

This existing code for GetVector2() will crash!  Resulting in 

Got a SIGABRT while executing native code. This usually indicates
a fatal error in the mono runtime or one of the native libraries 
used by your application.


This ISSUE has been reported waiting to be fixed;
in the interim a workaround to the problem is to simply declare the key as type Int16 instead of Byte
