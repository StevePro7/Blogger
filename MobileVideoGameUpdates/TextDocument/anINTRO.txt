INTRO
In 2015 we built Candy Kid as a simple maze chase video game on Windows PC using MonoGame available cross platform on iOS App Store and Android Google Play store.  Here we used an older version of MonoGame; initially 3.4 and 3.5.  In 2018 we built 3D City as a simple "Shoot 'em up" using the same techniques.

However, since being published on iOS App Store and Android Google Play store both Apple and Google require apps and games to be 64-bit compliant
Apple will stop support for 32-bit apps with iOS 11.0
Google require updates to apps and games on Google Play to target Android 9 (API level 28) or higher on November 1, 2019.

After this date, the Play Console will prevent you from submitting new APKs with a targetSdkVersion less than 28

At the time of this writing the latest version of MonoGame is 3.7.1

Therefore, in order to continue to have these games published on iOS App Store and Android Google Play store they must be upgrade to MonoGame 3.7.1

Let's check it out!

<br /><br />

Now both Apple and Google require apps + games be 64-bit compliant.  Apple will stop support for 32-bit on iOS 11.0.  Plus, Google require updates on Google Play to target minimum Android 9 (API level 28) or higher.

<br /><br />
All these factors mandate upgrades to our mobile games and rebuilt using latest version of MonoGame 3.7.1.
