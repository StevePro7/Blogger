Alt+O
I had this setup in VS2015 but not in VS2022

Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard
Search
EditorContextMenus.CodeWindow.ToggleHeaderCodeFile
Alt + O
BUT is already assigned to 
Edit.IntelliCode.APIUsageExamples

so search for this and remove Alt+O
Edit.IntelliCode.APIUsageExamples

then search for the following and apply
EditorContextMenus.CodeWindow.ToggleHeaderCodeFile

ALSO
Ensure you have the following checked
Projects + Solution | General
Track Active Item in Solution Explorer
