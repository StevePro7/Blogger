<u>Emulicious</u><br />
In 2013, we checked out <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.ie/2013/09/sega-console-programming.html">Sega Console Programming</a> with goal to build retro game in Z80 assembler for the Sega Master System.  However, the process to write Z80 assembly language from scratch seemed daunting.

<br /><br />
In 2019, since collaborating with <a href="http://www.smspower.org/forums/member6944">Calindro</a>, we now have the opportunity to understand relationship between C source code and the generated Z80 assembly: <a href="https://emulicious.net">Emulicious</a> will decorate Z80 code in the debugger with its corresponding C function!

<br /><br />
Launch Emulicious. Tools menu | ensure "Reopen Tools" option is checked. Launch the debugger. File menu | ensure "Load Sources automatically" is checked + Run menu | ensure "Suspend On Open" is checked.  Close

<br />
Ensure the <a href="https://github.com/SteveProXNA/CandyKidSMS/blob/master/dev/output.map">output.map</a> file is <b>not</b> deleted in build script.  E.g. both <a href="https://github.com/SteveProXNA/CandyKidSMS/blob/master/dev/output.sms">output.sms</a> and output.map are built and loaded into Emulicious.  The output.map maps C source code functions to the underlying Z80 assembly code.

<br /><br />
<i>Example</i><br />
Search for main function.  Ctrl + F | Find "_main"  Ctrl+click "main" to navigate there.  Ctrl+click any function name to navigate + inspect Z80 assembly code built for that function.  Click Alt+Left to navigate back.  Nice!
