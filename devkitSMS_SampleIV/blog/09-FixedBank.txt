<b>Fixed Bank</b><br />
In 2017, Astro Force by eruiz00 gave great example on how to store static data in fixedbank.c to scale out more game content and bank switch on-the-fly without consuming the precious 32KB ROM for game code.  

<br /><br />
Candy Kid attempts to replicate this strategy, unfortunately still hitting 32KB capacity for game code.  Next step could be store function pointer arrays in fixedbank.c like Astro Force to conserve more precious bytes!
