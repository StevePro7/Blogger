In 2017, we checked out devkitsms to setup productive development environment to build 8-bit retro video games for the Sega Master System. In 2018, we streamlined this build process to develop Simpsons Trivia.

In 2017, we checked out devkitsms to setup productive development environment to build 8-bit retro video games for the Sega Master System. In 2019, we improved the build process to develop Platform Explorer.

//In 2019, we improve the process further as we build Platform Explorer!



However, after five years of Sega Master System development we still have not made strong connection between C source code and underlying Z80 assembly.  Look for opportunities to consolidate 8-bit retro game development as we build Candy Kid!

However, after five years of SMS development we would like to connect C source code and underlying Z80 assembly.  Look for opportunities to consolidate more 8-bit retro game development as we build Candy Kid!
