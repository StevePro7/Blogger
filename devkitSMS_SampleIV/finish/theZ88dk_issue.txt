zcc - Frontend for the z88dk Cross-C Compiler - v13913-9abd768-20190119



Here is where I exposed the 2x missing APIs that I would use in Candy Kid


E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\z88dk2\CandyKidSMS_z88dk02\dev\devkit


e.g.
devkit.bat
E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\z88dk2\CandyKidSMS_z88dk02\dev\scripts


_link.bat
E:\Steven\INSTALLATIONSEGA\z88dk2\CandyKidSMS_z88dk02\dev\scripts

SUMARY
'_SMS_VDPFlags' not defined
'_PSGResume' not defined


SMS_VDPFlags used for fast sprite collision detection


PSGResume()
used on Continue screen and choose "YES" and the music resumes when play resumes also


Therefore, unfortunately would not be able to use z88dk


Do I add:
for some strange reason the screen was black anyway despite the fact that the debugger was working hard
