devkitSMS Sample II

01.
TEST
the ScreenManager with the array of function pointers in fixedbank.c	BANK'd
similar to AstroForce and the implementation is in the main ROM

currently all of my code here is in the main ROM and the Z80 assembly produced is massive...!!


02.
Recently, eruiz00 has shared the source code for Galactic Revenge. This game uses an up-to-date version of z88dk with devkitSMS [instead of sdcc] as the libraries are optimized in ASM + produce smaller object code.

Therefore, 3D City and future games could be written using z88dk with devkitSMS without graphics glitches


BUT this doesn't work for me!
revisit a test that I did during Candy Kid SDLC - there were 2x z88dk APIs that I use missing
e.g.
PSGresume()
// what was the other one??
