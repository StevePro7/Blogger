compile size instead of speed


Max out 32KB const...!!
summary so why give Sega Genesis SGDK a go

plus awesome homebrew community [like SMSPower??]


NASTY bug
Devkitsms blog buffer overrun!!


Bank switching
Ie group all content in same bank for level or boss


Fixed bank to store all static content


Bit masking to store more info in byte
E.g. level byte store no. Directions hi byte n type of tile in low byte n collision


Input Manager was re-worked and streamlined in Candy Kid from Platform Explorer
i.e.
inject the buttons you want to test rather than have "fat" InputManager


Repeat the Levels layout in Candy Kid similar to Platform Explorer


Collision Manager
fast n' slow
