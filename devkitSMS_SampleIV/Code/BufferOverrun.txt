Buffer overflow
03/06/2020

Buffer overflow [or overrun] is an anomaly where writing data to a buffer overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory.  These can be one of the worst programming bugs ever!

In Candy Kid, the player can be killed by any one of the three Candy Mama enemies; actors 0-2.  But Kid can also be killed a death tree "actor" 4.  When Kid is killed we reset the "kill" enemy and initially we reset enemy "4" on death tree which meant a buffer overflow for the enemy array!
