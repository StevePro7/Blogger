Summary
To summarize, 
To summarize, five years of SMS development have learnt lots blah blah blah

but after five years [game like Candy Kid] 32KB ROM capacity

due to time constraints need opportunity to refactor code bloat and duplication in order to safely stay withn 32KB ROM game code limit

Future:
could explore other options:

01.
build game code in Z80 assembly directly for complete control of byte code output
and at the start in 2013 this was an ultimate goal

02.
refactor and streamline existing C functions to be more generic and data driven
implement more function pointer arrays that can be move to fixed bank to converse bytes

03.
investigate more the possibility of using z88dk with devkitSMS and focus only on using supported APIs
//switch from zcc compiler using z88dk


04.
Upgrade from 8-bit Sega Master System to 16-bit Sega Mega Drive and bypass the 32KB ROM hard limit altogether!
https://segaretro.org/Sega_Mega_Drive


The final option is an interesting one.  Much like how the Sega Master System has the devkitSMS to support homebrew development using C language the SGDK has 

Similar to the devkitSMS for the SMS the SGDK [] 

Similar to the SMS has the devkitSMS the Sega Mega Drive has the SGDK
to support homebrew development also using C language

It would be interesting to see if [ideas + techniques used during] the five years of [SMS 8-bit] retro development could TRANSFER "transition" to 16-bit

be implemented
be re-used

Blog + Summary will point to fact that struggled to "cope" with 32KB ROM hard limit

Mention techniques tried to strip down size
e.g.
fixedbank

Therefore, during dev cycle re-wrote a couple of times when maxing out ROM limit

so at one point tried to switch to z88dk as heard from eruiz that can reduce size

TODO
get the quote from previous blog



But when I went to do this code wouldn't build 'cos version of z88dk was missing 2x APIs that I need
'_SMS_VDPFlags' not defined
'_PSGResume' not defined


Acknowledge that there is some code bloat in Candy Kid?
i.e. repeat esp main loop


Ultimately to ship this game changed build.bat to use -size instead of -speed


To summarize maybe 32 KB ROM not enough and time to explore beyond 8-bit and enter the 16-bit world
i.e.
"upgrade" from SMS to Sega Mega Drive
