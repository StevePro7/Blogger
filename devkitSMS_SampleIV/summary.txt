Summary
22/05/2020


Blog + Summary will point to fact that struggled to "cope" with 32KB ROM hard limit

Mention techniques tried to strip down size
e.g.
fixedbank

Therefore, during dev cycle re-wrote a couple of times when maxing out ROM limit

so at one point tried to switch to z88dk as heard from eruiz that can reduce size

TODO
get the quote from previous blog



But when I went to do this code wouldn't build 'cos version of z88dk was missing 2x APIs that I need
'_SMS_VDPFlags' not defined
'_PSGResume' not defined


Acknowledge that there is some code bloat in Candy Kid?
i.e. repeat esp main loop


Ultimately to ship this game changed build.bat to use -size instead of -speed


To summarize maybe 32 KB ROM not enough and time to explore beyond 8-bit and enter the 16-bit world
i.e.
"upgrade" from SMS to Sega Mega Drive
