Sample programs:

01.
Astro Force print out stuff via print() command not use "font" mgr?


02.
replace my screen_manager array of function pointers for
load
update

but put them in the fixedbank.c

similar to Astro Force array of function pointers


Will this work?
Will this move the big bulk "switch" statement out of main 32KB ROM and into the fixed bank?

Basically does this approach save any bytes?


03.
