In 2017, we checked out devkitsms to setup productive development environment to build 8-bit retro video games for the Sega Master System [SMS].  In 2019, we improved build process to develop Platform Explorer.
<br /><br />

However, after five years of SMS development we would like to connect more C source code with underlying Z80 assembly.  Look for opportunities to consolidate 8-bit retro game development as we build Candy Kid!
