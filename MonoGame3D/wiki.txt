In 2019, we updated games built using previous versions of MonoGame on Windows that were published on Android and iOS.  This included updating MonoGame content pipeline.  Armed with this knowledge we would now like to assemble 3D graphics and games built on Windows deployed to Android and iOS cross platform.
