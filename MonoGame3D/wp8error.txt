While it's possible to get corresponding build, there may be Hyper V Manager issues on some Windows PCs:

PIC

Windows Phone Emulator is unable to create a differencing disk: A virtual disk support provider for the specified file was not found.

All the information in this web page helped me

Although all the references to location for XDE.exe was not correct
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\8.0\xde.exe
Access is Denied

Instead XDE.exe was installed here for me
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\8.1\xde.exe



UNCHECK "Compress contents to save disk space" on the following following
C:\ Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v8.1\Emulation\Images

Rerun
This lead to the second error and had to repeat the UNCHECK but on this folder
C:\Users\TEST\AppData\Local\Microsoft\XDE

Now it worked OK

NB: did not need to "Turn on/off features for Hyper V Manager
or remove existing switch here:

Start | run | Hyper V Manager
Virtual Switch Manager

Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch
Remove
