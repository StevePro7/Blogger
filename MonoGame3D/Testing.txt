Launch VS2017
Create 3x MG projects
WIN
AND
IOS

Close and reopen in VS2019

Copy FBX to Content folder

Autodesk FBX Converter
Convert FBX
to same location
Rename

Launch Content pipepline
import files
Rebuild

this works on 
Windows
Android
iOS


Interesting:
could convert FBX
then I renamed ship__cv1 to ship
plus revert the code 
and it works
i.e.
loads model OK

Do NOT use ship__cv1 if you rename as won't work on Android or iOS
works on Windows tho'...??


Finally, let Autodesk rename the file
i.e. don't try and copy over itself
e.g. source dir == dest dir with same filename
otherwise will get error "Not enough parameters"
