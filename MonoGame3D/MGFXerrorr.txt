MGFX error
26/12/2020


The mgfx effect if sof an older release of MonoGame and needs to be rebuilt

D:\rSVN\3Dcity\3Dcity.AND

e.g.
Android build


what happened is that the default AND project that I used for this
already had a reference to MonoGame but was the latest at the time

i.e.
3.8.0.1641

so I need to down grade to version
3.7.1.189

this is because I still had the older version of MonoGame installed
i.e.
3.7

Control Panel
MonoGame SDK
3.7.1.189
