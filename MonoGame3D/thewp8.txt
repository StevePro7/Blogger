I had a similar issue with Windows Phone 10 Preview Emulator under Visual Studio 2015 RC. The solution was:

Go to "Turn Windows features on or off"
Remove Hyper-V
Restart
Reinstall Hyper-V
Restart
You're a go :)

Recently i encounter the same problem, it turns out that you have to install windows phone 8.1 sdk in order to run windows phone 8 app unter windows 10. Surprised ?... me neither :D

Uncompress folder
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v8.1\Emulation\Images

Windows Phone Emulator is unable to verify that the virtual machine is running


INTERESTING
Is xde.exe meant to be this one here
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\8.1\

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\8.1\xde.exe" /vhd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v8.1\Emulation\Images\flash.vhd" /name WP8-SDK


THIS WORKS!
Start | run | cmd
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v8.1\Emulation\Images"
xde.exe /vhd flash.vhd /name WP8-SDK

xde.exe /vhd flash.vhd /name "Emulator 8.1 1080P 6 inch.test"

got the same "compressed error" that pointed to AppData specifically here:
C:\Users\TEST\AppData\Local\Microsoft\XDE

Right click XDE folder | Properties | Advanced and unchecked "Compress"
cmd line works now
xde.exe /vhd flash.vhd /name "Emulator 8.1 1080P 6 inch.test"

Final note:
If F5 from VS2015 and still get the original "differencing" error the launch Hyper V Manager
Connect to the emulator manually first then retry and error should go away because the emulator is running
