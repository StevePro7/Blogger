WORKING
I create new HelloWorld project from scratch on Linux and it worked
e.g.
cd ~/Steven/GoLang
mkdir NewTest

Launch GoLang
New Project
Location	~/Steven/GoLang/NewTest
GOROOT		Go 1.16.5	/usr/local/go
Index entire GOPATH		checked
Create

New file
main.go

enter code
NOTE
package NewTest

when go to run this Goland will complain
Run | Run...
go build main.go

accept defaults
Run

Configuration is still incorrect.  Do you want to edit it again?
Continue

Compilation finished with exit code 0
Compiled binary cannot be executed

change to
package main

NOW works OK


ERRORS
01.
Go is not a go file
Edit configuration

BEFORE
Files	/home/stevepro/Steven/GoLang/Test03

AFTER
Files	/home/stevepro/Steven/GoLang/Test03/main.go

IMPORTANT
Go tool arguments
leave blank

BEFORE	had -i
when build will get message
go build: -i flag is deprecated


Finally check EditConfiguration
this seems to be how to get all of this working

i.e.
Build + Run main executable

Run kind		File
Files			~/Steven/GoLang/Test/main.go
Output directory

Working directory	~/Steven/GoLang/Test
Environment
Go tool arguments
Program arguments
Module			Test


Go settings
GOROOT			Go 1.16.5 /usr/local/go
GOPATH			~/go
