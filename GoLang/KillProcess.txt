go run main.go
curl http://localhost:1323


Could NOT kill process in order to re-run program...!


Solution:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11583562/how-to-kill-a-process-running-on-particular-port-in-linux


fuser -k 1323/tcp
fuser -k 8080/tcp


this kills the Terminal that executed command
go run main.go


Therefore, can now re-run process again and again...!
