struct interface
27/09/2021

I would like a way to explicitly know when a struct implements an interface in GoLang
[or not]

but there doesn't seem to be a compile time way to know
only runtime

You can also take Alpha's solution:

val := MyType("hello")
var i interface{} = val
v, ok := i.(Somether)
... and reduce it further:

val := MyType("hello")
v, ok := interface{}(val).(Somether)
