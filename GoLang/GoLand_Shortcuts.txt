Migrating to GoLand from a Code Editor: Tips & Tricks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDHET-k4zz4

HOWEVER
I tried this manually

Goland use VSCode keymap
Settings... | Plugins| VSCode Keymap
Settings... | Keymap | VSCode

IMPORTANT
must do both steps
not sure if I have to close GoLand IDE and re-open??


Reference
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12062-vscode-keymap

now get all of
F9, F10, F11
Alt + Left

but I lose the previos e.g. Ctrl + F12...!!

Instead
Ctrl + P
file file	e.g. main.go
Ctrl + R	same but recent files listed


File structure
Ctrl + F12		old that doesn't work now
Ctrl + Shift + O	maybe just use this for now

IMPORTANT
Navigate | File Path
do NOT do this via keyboard shortcut e.g. VNC Viewer OR on keyboard
as it "kills" Linux Ubuntu and forces reboot
if want to use then simply do via Navigate menu


F10
F11
Shift+F11	does not work VNC Viewer	must use icon!


TODO
No resume button
does not seem to be keyboard shortcut for 	Resume


When coding try Distraction Free mode
to go full screen on one file at a time


Git integration
Must choose rollback to discard any non committed changes



VS CODE
VS Code icons

vscode-icons
https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/09/08/icon-themes

//Material icons


Zoom Out
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36040857/visual-studio-code-change-font-size-for-file-explorer-tray/46344568

one final thing that I tried after updating the icons
vscode-icons

was to Zoom Out to increase the font size of the files + folders
and reduce the code text font size from 14 to 12


VS Code 
keyboard mappings
e.g.
default Paste
Ctrl + Shift + V

want
Ctrl + V

File menu | Preferences | Keyboard shortcuts
filter "Paste"

Terminal: Paste into Active Terminal
Ctrl + Shift + V

edit
Ctrl + V


TODO?
Notebook: Paste Cell Above
Ctrl + Shift + V

do I need to change this also to be in-sync??



GoLand
Ctrl + Shift + O		File structure
OR
can toggle Structure on bottom LHS

Breakpoints
can toggle Favorites on bottom LHS | Breakpoints
or
Run | View Breakpoints... 
edit, delete breakpoints etc from here 



Settings
Ctrl + Comma
auto pops up the setting configuration window


IMPORTANT
Implement interface
e.g.
Chp13
bzip2

writer
Cannot use 'w' (type *writer) as the type io.WriteCloserType does not implement 'io.WriteCloser' as some methods are missing:Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)Close() error

click "writer"
type writer struct

Code menu | Implement Methods...
Choose interface to implement:
io.WriterCloser
Enter

interface stubs are generated
error goes away!


Typo
Ctrl + Comma
Settings | Editor | Inspections | Proofreading | Typo
Profile:	Default IDE

I only want spell check / typos for comments:
Process code		Unchecked
Process literals	Unchecked
Process comments	CHECKED


How do you know if a Type implements an interface?

e.g.
var _ io.Writer = new(bytes.Buffer)

Reference:
https://golangbyexample.com/go-check-if-type-implements-interface
https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1588481241-How-to-check-whether-a-struct-implements-an-interface-in-GoLang

I don't think there is any object browser like .NET that can do this for you


Goland
Enable module integration

if, for some reason, you need a dependent Go module and you "go get" from the Terminal
yet there are still errors in the Terminal then ensure that the following has been enabled
Enable module integration

Ctrl + Comma
Go | Go Modules | Enable Go modules integration	CHECKED

go mod tidy
and now everything should work w/o any "Problems"
