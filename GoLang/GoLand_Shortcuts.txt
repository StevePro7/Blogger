Migrating to GoLand from a Code Editor: Tips & Tricks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDHET-k4zz4

HOWEVER
I tried this manually

Goland use VSCode keymap
Settings... | Plugins| VSCode Keymap
Settings... | Keymap | VSCode

IMPORTANT
must do both steps
not sure if I have to close GoLand IDE and re-open??


Reference
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12062-vscode-keymap

now get all of
F9, F10, F11
Alt + Left

but I lose the previos e.g. Ctrl + F12...!!

Instead
Ctrl + P
file file	e.g. main.go
Ctrl + R	same but recent files listed


File structure
Ctrl + F12		old that doesn't work now
Ctrl + Shift + O	maybe just use this for now

IMPORTANT
Navigate | File Path
do NOT do this via keyboard shortcut e.g. VNC Viewer OR on keyboard
as it "kills" Linux Ubuntu and forces reboot
if want to use then simply do via Navigate menu


F10
F11
Shift+F11	does not work VNC Viewer	must use icon!


TODO
No resume button
does not seem to be keyboard shortcut for 	Resume


When coding try Distraction Free mode
to go full screen on one file at a time


Git integration
Must choose rollback to discard any non committed changes



VS CODE
VS Code icons

//Material icons


Zoom Out
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36040857/visual-studio-code-change-font-size-for-file-explorer-tray/46344568

one final thing that I tried after updating the icons
vscode-icons

was to Zoom Out to increase the font size of the files + folders
and reduce the code text font size from 14 to 12
