AWESOME!!
Ctrl + Shift + O	Navigate | File Structure
but the default for	Navigate | File Path		kills my laptop	black screen!
[had to re-install NVidia drivers again!!]

However, can unmap the "deadly" key and re-map something that doesn't crash system:

Ctrl + ,	Settings
Keymap
Search File Path

find Navigate | File Path
right click |	remove "deadly" key combo
right click |	Add Keyboard Shortcut		e.g. Ctrl + Shift + N

NB:
maybe choose different combo? as this one creates new window in VS code??
I can't find an equivalent in VS Code

Example
Layout Problem window in VScode + GoLand to the RHS so you can see issues as you type
similar to pylint

GoLand

I saw that you can Git | Rollback on the LHS tab
which is equivalent to Discard changes and is more intuitive in VS Code


Implement interface
Ctrl + I

Reference:
IDE.txt
Interfaces.txt
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\Blogger\GoLang\notes

and choose interface
https://www.jetbrains.com/go/guide/tips/implement-an-interface

component
sprite_renderer
GamingInGo


Settings | Font
