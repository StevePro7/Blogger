Begin to go thru some code exercises from the Golang book and make notes


01.
can "hide" unused vars or package imports so Save won't remove them until actually used
can prepend _ for unused packages but can do for vars?	Need them


02.
REST API invoked concurrently
how to test for concurrency by "load" up REST API?
ensure there are no race conditions?


03.
how can get "threadID" equivalence of goroutine ID?
they purposely don't have it but there must be some way to identify each goroutine by ID


04.
TESTING
could not get unit tests and bench mark tests working - need to revise!


05.
Simliar to Python	revise slices and beg / end points
s[:4]
s[1:]


06.
flag.Parse()
