Sega Genesis blurb

Taken out of Platform Explorer Code Complete
but could use for SGDK setup if/as necc.


It seems development for the 8-bit Master System may have declined in favor for the 16-bit Sega <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis">Genesis</a>?  Especially, with the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/01/sega-mega-drive-mini-retro-console-arrives-in-september">announcement</a> "Sega Mega Drive mini retro console arrives in Septempter-2019".
<br /><br />
If this is true then fortunately there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-based equivalent to the devkitSMS for the Genesis: the <a href="https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK">SGDK</a>.  Apart from targeting 16-bit hardware and different API to learn, the development process would still be the same!
