Hi Steven,

hovering shows the value AT the hovered address. I.e. it can be used to see the values of variables (like with IDEs).

The hotkeys are the same as in Eclipse.

Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to work on this today.
I've attached the current WIP version that comes with some minor improvements.

Kind Regards
Michael

The ips files are created using my editor KiddEd. KiddEd allows to edit most content/data of the game but it cannot freely modify game mechanics, i.e., the code of the game. That's what's my role in creating the hacks. I supply custom patches that they can apply to their hacks to alter game mechanics. For example for Azled I changed a lot of the physics and the behavior of the rice cake. 
For Bubble Dragon as an example I made him always shoot. For Legende of Oliv I don't remember what I did for him. The game was already finished around a year ago.
