Future
After giving the presentation earlier in 2019, I was advised afterwards about a new interesting development connecting Artificial Intelligence and Video Games now described as Reinforcement Learning in Video Games.

Therefore, this seems excellent motivation to investigate Machine Learning Software such as TensorFlow for various applications of ML such as Reinforcement Learning and see if this can be applied to Video Games

Retrospective XII


Video games are an interesting field of study for many Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers especially with Pacman because it is simple enough to be understood quickly and does not require powerful machine to run.

One approach could be to train automatic bots to play video games like Pacman via Reinforcement Learning: RL algorithms learn policies that associate good actions to execute in different game states based on reward obtained during the game simulation. Reinforcement Learning has also been used in other domains such as First Person Shooters like Doom.

Therefore, retro game development with Pacman and Doom clones seem like an excellent avenue to pursue with regards to future applications in software with Artificial Intelligence, ML and Reinforcement Learning J
