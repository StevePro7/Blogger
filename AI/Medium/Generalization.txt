Why Reliable Machine Learning Means Thinking Beyond Accuracy Scores

ML
not about fitting a dataset
its about learning patterns that last

ML model fails in Prod  Why?
It learned to memorize  NOT generalize


Generalization
model ability to make correct predictions on new unseen data


Model that memorizes patterns in training data performs well
on that data but poorly elsewhere

Model that generalizes learns the structure behind those patterns
and applies it flexibly


Memorization	high training accuracy, low test performance
Generalization	balanced performance on both


Model
accuracy	how well a model fits known data
generalization	how well it adapts


Avoid accuracy trap
1. Use validation wisely
2. Control model complexity
3. Regularize everything
4. Simulate the real world


SUMMARY
Metrics that matter more than accuracy

Precision / Recall / F1-score
esp. for imbalanced data

ROC AUC
measures separation power

Expected Calibration Error	ECE
shows how well predicted probabilities align with outcomes

Out-of-sample performance
track how metrics behave after deployment


Generalization = discipline
building models that think not just remember
