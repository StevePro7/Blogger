ML Training loop

EPOCH
one full pass thru the entire training dataset


ML models learn by adjusting their weights gradually
One pass thru the data usually isn't enough for the model to understand patterns

Each epoch the model
* sees the same data again
* makes predictions
* measures the error
* updates its weights


STUDY
each study session = one epoch
your brain [model] improves a bit each time


BATCHES
data        = 1000 rows
batch size  = 100
equals      = 10 batches per epoch
i.e.
1 epoch     = 10 batches    [10 iterations]
5 epochs    = 50 batches    [50 iterations]


TERMINOLOGY
epoch       one pass thru all training data
batch       small chunk of data
iteration   one update step [one batch processed]

Typical range
10 - 100 epochs


SUMMARY
epoch       unit of time in the training loop

understanding epoch = helps control model's learning process
epochs show how far model has gone and how much more it can learn
