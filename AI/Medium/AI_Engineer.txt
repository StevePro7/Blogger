The Job Market Reality
LinkedIn’s Jobs on the Rise 2025 report shows "AI Engineer” is the fastest-growing job title on the platform, outpacing every other tech role in the past three years.


What companies are actually hiring for:

AI engineers work hand-in-hand with data scientists, developers, and business teams to build and roll out AI tools that tackle real business challenges. They transform models into practical, production-ready AI applications.


Interview questions for real AI engineers:

"Design a distributed training system for a 70B parameter model”
"How would you reduce inference latency from 500ms to 50ms?”
"Explain backpropagation through a transformer layer”
"Debug this training loss curve — why does it diverge at epoch 23?”
"Architect a RAG system handling 100M documents”You’re Not an AI Engineer. You’re Just Using ChatGPT.
