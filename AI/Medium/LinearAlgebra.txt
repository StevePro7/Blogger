Linear Algebra
Understand vectors and matrices

Vector
single data point

Matrix
dataset

Model Parameters
weights in nerual networks stored as matrices

Transformations
images, text embeddings, feature spaces
all manipulated using matrix manipulations

Training process
gradient descent updates nothing but vector operations


BUILDING BLOCKS
Vectors
list of numbers that represent features
[size, number_of_rooms, age]	3D vector

Matrices
grid of numbers [Rows x Cols]
e.g.
dataset 100 houses w/ 3x features = 100 * 3 matrix

Matrix Multiplication
operation that powers neural networks
e.g.
multiply input data [matrix] by model weights [matrix] = predictions

Dot product
measures similarity btwn vectors
e.g.
recommendation systems

Transformations
rotating, scaling, projecting data using matrices
e.g.
Computer Vision: images transformed into feature vectors thru matrix operations


EXAMPLE
Y = XW + b

X → your dataset matrix (rows = houses, columns = features)
W → your weight vector
b → bias
Y → predicted prices

Scale idea up w/ multiple layers of weights and activations = neural networks


1. Start Small: With a Pen and Paper
a = [2, 3]
b = [4, 1]

ADD
a + b = [6, 4]
combining features

SCALE
2 * a = [4, 6]
amplifying input features

ML
dot product = basis of similarity measures how neural networks compute weighted sums
i.e.
Matrix multiplication = a * b	[described as "dot" product]


2. Move to Python + NumPy
~\GitHub\StevePro7\PythonSetup\Medium\AI\LinearAlgebra\pythonProject\Ex01.py
Operations are the backbone of libraries
TensorFlow
PyTorch


3. Experiment with Matrices
~\GitHub\StevePro7\PythonSetup\Medium\AI\LinearAlgebra\pythonProject\Ex02.py
Linear regression in matrix form
Built first ML model!!


4. Visualize Transformations
~\GitHub\StevePro7\PythonSetup\Medium\AI\LinearAlgebra\pythonProject\Ex03.py
set of 2D points	[co-ordinates]
apply transformation matrix:
rotation, scaling
plot before vs. after

Neural networks apply transformations layer by layer
Understand this visually makes "hidden layers" less abstract


5. Connect It to AI Concepts
dot prodct = similarity		used in recommendation engines
matrix multiplications 		linear regression
				deep learning forward pass
transformations			feature space changes in embeddings
		e.g.		word2vec
				image embeddings
scaling and normalizing vectors	preprocessing before training


SUMMARY
understanding vectors and matrices:

* deep learning feel less like "magic" and more like layers of transformations
* concepts like embeddings, attention and back-propagation become logical extensions [not mysteries]
* confidence to learn more advanced math [calculus, probability, optimization]	see how to connect data

House analogy:
* Linear Algebra = foundation
* without it	 = shaky
* with it	 = build computer vision, NLP, Generative AI etc.
