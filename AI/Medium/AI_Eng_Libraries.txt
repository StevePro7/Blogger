01. NumPy		Backbone of every AI stack
Tensor, matrix, linear algebra
broadcasting + vectorization


02. Pandas		Raw data is a mess
AI starts w/ clean data
wrangle, filter, merge datasets


03. Scikit learn	Swiss army knife of ML
Regression to clustering
classical ML tasks
build + test ML pipelines in few lines of code


04. TensorFlow		Enterprise muscle
Heavyweight champion of deep learning
distributed training + cross-platform deployment


05. PyTorch		Researcher's favorite
TensorFlow 	= enterprise-grade
PyTorch		= creativity unleashed

dynamic computation graphs, cleaner syntax, massive community
every serious AI researcher is prototyping in PyTorch first


06. Keras		Deep learning without drama
high-level API for TensorFlow
perfect for quick prototypes and educational experiments


07. OpenCV		Making machines see
Computer vision isn't just face filters + self-driving cars
image processing, object detection, optical flow
OpenCV + PyTorch = real-time inference pipelines


08. NLTK + SpaCy	When words matter
NLTK	linguistic analysis			experiment
SpaCy	crushes it in Production-level NLP	deployment


09. Hugging Face	Transformers - NLP supercharged
HuggingFace democratized NLP
why train a language model from scratch when you can use BERT, GPT, T5


10. XGBoost + LightGBM	Tabular titans
dominate structured data problems
when deep learning is overkill	want accuracy that delivers


11. FastAI		Deserve shortcuts
deep learning with fewer headaches	built on PyTorch
transfer learning, image classification, text generation all simplified
perfect for learners - fast results w/o compromising rigor


12. Matplolib, Seaborn	Visualization
data w/o visualization = noise
Matplotlib	reliable
Seaborn		pretty
Plotly		interactive


13. PyCaret		Machine learning in lazy mode
run multiple models and compare them in one go
AutoML that works
perfect for prototyping and non-ML experts who need results fast


14. Gradio + Streamlit	Show don't tell
two libraries that turn models into web apps	no Javascript req'd
deploy PyTorch model as a demo in under 10 minutes


15. LangChain		Brain behind LLM workflows
if building AI agents or LLM-powered applications then LangChain = glue
chain models, memory and prompts together logically


16. Faiss		When similarity search gets serious
FB faiss library = search millions of vectors in milliseconds
recommendation systems, semantic search and embeddings
combine sentence transformers for magic-level semantic search


17. PyTorch Lightning	Order in the chaos
gives structure, reproducibility, scalability
serious teams use to move from research into production
