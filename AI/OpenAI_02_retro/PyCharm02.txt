Launch PyCharm
/home/stevepro/GitHub/SteveProXNA2/OpenAItesting/RetroCheatSheet


python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate


pip install --upgrade pip
pip install stable-retro

cd examples
python examples/copy_files.py


IMPORTANT
when get errors then just revert the default Python interpreter to
RetroCheatSheet

as was created before - not sure why this works as the pip list
is the same
