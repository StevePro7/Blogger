OLD
openai

do hello world example
from read the docs
https://retro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

HW example
discuss JSON files??

IMPORTANT
if on openai and try to debug step then some may not work
get that 0.21 BS as using old OpenAI gym NOT Gymnasium

list 2x "fixes" that used to work 
but don't seem to work anymore!!

even with that weird git command
still get messed up classic control render

DEBUG step thru code
suggest better to use
farma-foundation
stable-retro
instead


Fork this repo instead
