int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

Choose target in drop down
e.g
nes | Debug
F5

Popup
Enter executable in drop down list
gym-retro-integration

Debug break step thru code!!


TESTS
/home/stevepro/GitHubX/openai/retro/tests

Not sure how the C++ tests got built
most likely via building the project via CMakeLists [above]

Launch CLion
Edit configurations debug drop down
scroll down to section near bottom
under All CTest

there will be one test target per C++ translation unit
e.g.
data.cpp		test-data
emulator.cpp		test-emulator

The test-* is the built binary via Gtest
Choose anyone
e.g.
test-data
set breakpoint in tests/data.cpp

F5
Debug step thru the code!
