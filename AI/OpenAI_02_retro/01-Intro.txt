OpenAI Gym 

is an open source Python library for developing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing standard API to communicate between algorithms and environments

Gym provides a wide range of environments, including classic control problems, Atari games, and robotics.


In this post we check out OpenAI Gym Retro:
Gym Retro 
lets you turn classic video games into Gym environments for reinforcement learning and includes many other Emulated Systems we have developed for in the past including Nintendo GameBoy / GameBoy Color, Sega MegaDrive and or course the Sega Master System!



comes with integrations for ~1000 games. It uses various emulators that support the Libretro API, making it fairly easy to add new emulators.
