In the previous post, we checked out OpenAI Gym: an open source library in Python used for reinforcement learning algorithms development to communicate between environments such as classic Atari video games.
<br /><br />
In the this post, we check out OpenAI Retro source code repository which lets you turn classic video games into Gym environments for reinforcement learning with classic Atari video games and many other Emulated Systems including: Nintendo GameBoy / GameBoy Color, the Sega MegaDrive and the Sega Master System.

Let's check it out!


In the previous post we checked out OpenAI Farma Cheat Sheet.

OpenAI Gym 

is an open source Python library for developing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing standard API to communicate between algorithms and environments

Gym provides a wide range of environments, including classic control problems, Atari games, and robotics.


In this post we check out OpenAI Gym Retro:
Gym Retro 
lets you turn classic video games into Gym environments for reinforcement learning and includes many other Emulated Systems we have developed for in the past including Nintendo GameBoy / GameBoy Color, Sega MegaDrive and or course the Sega Master System!



comes with integrations for ~1000 games. It uses various emulators that support the Libretro API, making it fairly easy to add new emulators.
