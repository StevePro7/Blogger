<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, we have now setup Stable Retro environments for classic 8-bit video game systems like the Sega Master System and 16-bit video game systems like the Sega Genesis [MD] the next step would be to use reinforcement learning to train a bot to play classic emulated video games using this Gym Retro setup.
<br /><br />
Consequently, Python NEAT is a popular library for training neural networks using genetic algorithms.  There is an excellent Open AI and NEAT Tutorial series that integrates Sonic the Hedgehog as a testbed for applied reinforcement learning to provide a rich, rewarding, and visually complex environment that is well-suited for evolving neural networks.  Ultimate goal: would be to use this as inspiration to integrate more Indie games!
