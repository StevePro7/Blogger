https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro
A fork of gym-retro ('lets you turn classic video games into Gymnasium environments for reinforcement learning') with additional games, emulators and supported platforms. Since gym-retro is in maintenance now and doesn't accept new games, platforms or bug fixes, you can instead submit PRs with new games or features here in stable-retro.
