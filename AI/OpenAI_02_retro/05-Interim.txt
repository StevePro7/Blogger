<u>Stable Retro</u></br />
As per previous post, we learned that the lack of maintenance for OpenAI Gym prompted Gymnasium: which is an open source fork of the OpenAI Gym library maintained by the Farma Foundation.  As Gym Retro is built upon an unmaintained version of the OpenAI Gym library then this may explain errors encountered above <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span>
<br /><br />
Similarly, as Gym Retro is built upon OpenAI Gym, Stable Retro is built upon Farma Foundation Gymnasium.  Stable Retro lets you convert classic video games into Gymnasium environments for Reinforcement Learning.

A fork of gym-retro ('lets you turn classic video games into Gymnasium environments for reinforcement learning') with additional games, emulators and supported platforms. Since gym-retro is in maintenance now and doesn't accept new games, platforms or bug fixes, you can instead submit PRs with new games or features here in stable-retro.
