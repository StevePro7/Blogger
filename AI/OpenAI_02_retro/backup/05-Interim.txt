<u>Stable Retro</u></br />
As per previous <a href="https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2024/09/openai-farma-cheat-sheet.html">post</a>, we learned that the lack of maintenance for OpenAI Gym prompted <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html">Gymnasium</a>: which is an open source fork of the OpenAI Gym library maintained by The <a href="https://farama.org">Farama Foundation</a>.  As Gym Retro built upon an unmaintained version of the OpenAI Gym library then this may explain errors encountered above <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span>
<br /><br />
Similarly, like Gym Retro built upon OpenAI Gym, <a href="https://stable-retro.farama.org">Stable Retro</a> is built upon Farama Foundation Gymnasium.  <a href="https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro">Stable Retro</a> lets you convert classic video games into Gymnasium environments for Reinforcement Learning!

A fork of gym-retro ('lets you turn classic video games into Gymnasium environments for reinforcement learning') with additional games, emulators and supported platforms. Since gym-retro is in maintenance now and doesn't accept new games, platforms or bug fixes, you can instead submit PRs with new games or features here in stable-retro.
