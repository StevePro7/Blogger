TENSOR
way to organize numbers
container for data	similar to arrays or matrices

scalar		0D	7
vector		1D	[2, 5, 9]
matrix		2D	[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]


Tensor
give a unified way to handle everything from single number to multi-dimensional datasets


Why tensors?
real world data e.g. images, audio, video = multi-dimensional

image
2D tensor	height * width
3D tensor	height * width * RGB


Neural networks need structure flexible to handle all these shapes
Tensors = perfect


Tensors + Deep Learning
input data	images, text, sound
weights + biases
operations	matrix multiplications, dot products, convolutions


Tensors power Neural Networks
data enters as a tensor		batch 32x color images = [32 * 28 * 28 * 3]
operations happen		apply transformations to tensors
backpropagation uses tensors	gradients [tensors] flow backward to adjust weights
model learns			each iteration tensor operations shape network intelligence


SUMMARY
tensors = containers for numbers: generalizing scalars, vectors, matrices
modern data [images, videos, text] = multi-dimensional
libraries like NumPy, PyTorch and TensorFlow = work w/ tensors simple
neural networks rely on tensor operations for learning + predictions



CODE

Ex01
import numpy as np

scalar = np.array(5)
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]],
                    [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

print(scalar.shape)     # ()
print(vector.shape)     # (3, )
print(matrix.shape)     # (2, 2)
print(tensor.shape)     # (2, 2, 2)


Ex02
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Perform operations
# Matrix addition
z = x + y

# Matrix multiplication
w = torch.matmul(x, y)

print("Addition:\n", z)
print("Multiplication:\n", w)

# OUTPUT
# Addition:
# tensor([[ 6.,  8.],
#        [10., 12.]])
#Multiplication:
# tensor([[19., 22.],
#        [43., 50.]])
