Problem statement
The five Ws of Who, What, When, Where, and Why


Feature engineering
features as
components or attributes of the problem you wish to solve
features are one of the biggest impacts on your
model's performance

feature importance
is used to determine what features are actually driving your predictions


Obtain datasets
A dataset is used to train the model on what the output
should be

overfitting
your dataset is composed of all the same data
points and your model will not be able to properly predict

A diverse but representative dataset is required for machine
learning algorithms to properly build a production-ready model


Feature extraction
Feature extraction, depending on the size of your dataset and your features,
could be one of the most time-consuming elements of the model building process


Model training
After feature extraction, you are now prepared to train your model


Model evaluation
model evaluation is to hold out a portion of your dataset for evaluation. The idea behind this
is to take known data, submit it to your trained model, and measure the efficacy of your model


Supervised ML
passing the known outputs as part of the training to the model.
labelling

Unsupervised ML
typical use case is when figuring out the input
and output labels proves to be difficult


ML Algorithms
- Binary classification
- Regression
- Anomaly detection
- Clustering
- Matrix factorization

Binary classification
output of a model trained with a binary classification algorithm will return a true or false conviction

Regression
return a real value as opposed to a binary algorithm or ones that return from a set of specific values

NB: 
linear		return predicted value
logistic	return probability of outcome occurring

Anomaly detection
looks for unexpected events in the data submitted
to the model

Clustering	Unsupervised ML
offer a unique solution to problems
where finding the closest match to related items is the desired solution.

Matrix factorization
provides a powerful and easy-to-use
algorithm for providing recommendations
