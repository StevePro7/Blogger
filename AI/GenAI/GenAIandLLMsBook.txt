languages, and specialties, these technologies are driving a new era of convenience,
productivity, and connectivity.


Traditional AI uses predictive models to classify data and
predict outcomes within a specific context or domain

whereas
Gen AI models generate entirely new outputs rather than simply making
predictions based on prior experience

This shift from prediction to creation opens up new realms of innovation:
e.g.
in healthcare
a traditional predictive model can spot a suspicious lesion in an MRI of lung tissue

whereas
A GenAI app can also determine the likelihood that a patient will develop pneumonia or some other type of lung
disease and offer treatment recommendations based on best practices gleaned from thousands of similar cases


Chp.01
Traditional AI = machine learning [ML]
focused on analytic tasks like classification and prediction

Generative AI [GenAI] goes a step further with its ability to create new, original content

GenAI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that uses neural networks and deep learning algorithms to
identify patterns within existing data as a basis for generating original content

ML

DL
revolutionized the AI landscape with its capability to handle large amounts of data and execute complex tasks
employs multiple layers of interconnected neurons, allowing for more sophisticated learning and representation
of data
Breakthru lead to significant advancements in NLP [Natural Language Processing] launching the era of
general-purpose AI bots

RNN [Recurrent Neural Networks] excelled in sequential data processing, such as language modeling.
These technologies laid the foundation for gen AI.


LLMs
advanced AI systems designed to understand the intricacies of human language and to generate
intelligent, creative responses when queried
Successful LLMs are trained on enormous data sets

LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on enormous data sets and designed to understand the intricacies of
human language /*and*/ to generate intelligent, creative responses when queried.

Using deep learning techniques these [large lanugage] models
excel at understanding and generating text similar to human-produced content
and
power many modern applications, including content creation tools like
customer service chatbots
