Gen AI and LLMs are revolutionizing our personal and professional lives
From supercharged digital assistants to seemingly omniscient chatbots
//with enterprise data across industries, languages, and specialities
these technologies are driving a new era of convenience, productivity, and 
connectivity

languages, and specialties, these technologies are driving a new era of convenience,
productivity, and connectivity.


Traditional AI uses predictive models to classify data and
predict outcomes within a specific context or domain

whereas
Gen AI models generate entirely new outputs rather than simply making
predictions based on prior experience

This shift from prediction to creation opens up new realms of innovation:
e.g.
in healthcare
a traditional predictive model can spot a suspicious lesion in an MRI of lung tissue

whereas
A GenAI app can also determine the likelihood that a patient will develop pneumonia or some other type of lung
disease and offer treatment recommendations based on best practices gleaned from thousands of similar cases


Chp.01
Traditional AI = machine learning [ML]
focused on analytic tasks like classification and prediction

Generative AI [GenAI] goes a step further with its ability to create new, original content

GenAI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that uses neural networks and deep learning algorithms to
identify patterns within existing data as a basis for generating original content

AI
ML

DL
revolutionized the AI landscape with its capability to handle large amounts of data and execute complex tasks
employs multiple layers of interconnected neurons, allowing for more sophisticated learning and representation
of data
Breakthru lead to significant advancements in NLP [Natural Language Processing] launching the era of
general-purpose AI bots

RNN [Recurrent Neural Networks] excelled in sequential data processing, such as language modeling.
These technologies laid the foundation for gen AI.


//LLMs
//advanced AI systems designed to understand the intricacies of human language and to generate
//intelligent, creative responses when queried
//Successful LLMs are trained on enormous data sets

LLMs
LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on enormous data sets and designed to understand the intricacies of
human language /*and*/ to generate intelligent, creative responses when queried.

Using deep learning techniques these [large lanugage] models
excel at understanding and generating text similar to human-produced content
and
power many modern applications, including content creation tools like
customer service chatbots


Pg.5
2017 introduced transformer architecture
deep learning model that replaced traditional recurrent and convolutional structures

LLMs are based on this newer transformer architecture and have enabled  new AI capabilities
such as ChatGPT

GPT = Generative Pre-trained Transformer


Pg.7
LLMs for content generation
Popular use of this technology [LLMs] in the enterprise is to develop chatbots that engage in
conversational interatctions w/ business users
//helping them obtain accurate answers to their Qs


SIDE NOTE
genai example of healthcare chatbox what can it do

GenAI powered healthcare chatbot can assist patients, healthcare providers and medical administrators
e.g.
1.  Symptom Checker
2.  Appointment Scheduling
3.  Medication Reminders
4.  Health Tips and Preventive Care
5.  Lab Results Interpretation
6.  Chronic Disease Management
7.  Mental Health Support
8.  Insurance and Billing Assistance
9.  Virtual Consultations and Telemedicine
10. Health Records Access
11. Emergency Triage

By leveraging conversational AI a healthcare chatbot can improve patient engagement,
provide real-time support, and optimize the workflow for healthcare providers

It can act as a 24/7 assistant, delivering personalized healthcare advice while
ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance

NB: open-source LL Models available on GitHub and Hugging Face

Pg.10
Cloud Data platform
Data is your core differentiator in the age of gen AI. The best way
to harness and protect enterprise data for gen AI initiatives is
to consolidate disparate sources into a cloud data platform that
provides strong security and governance for data and the models
customized with that data.

IMPORTANT
2023 Bloomberg Intelligence report
GenAI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years
//from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022 - a compound annual growth of 42%


Pg.14
Neural networks key component to AI systems
but
today's AI models also have "attention mechanism" that help encoder + decoder work together more effectively
Encoder     understands input
Decoder     generates  output

based on transformer architecture
power lies on capability to learn relevance of each word to all other words


Pg.15
Prompt
text you provide to a [large] language model

Completion
prompt given to the model which then generates an answer

Inference
process of using model to generate text


Reinforcment Learning
[with human feedback] helps guide the model's output


Pg.16
Vecotr embeddings
LLM => large datasets => represented in vector form
i.e.
words are represented by numbers in multi-dimensional space
this makes it easier for models to compare and analyze information

Vector DBs
store data as mathematical representations that can be easily parsed by ML models
enable GenAI systems to quickly retrieve relevant data during generation + inference processes

Ensure data platform includes vector search functionality that helps contextualize LLMs
with your data such as RAG [Retrieval-Augmented Generation]

Parameters      LLM
Pg.21
trainable variables in an LLM

more params = more "knowledge" but
fewer params consume fewer [compute] resources + faster to fine-tune + deploy

LLM criteria


Pg.22
Tailor LLM to meet specific needs
ICL             In-Context Learning         dynamically update understanding during conversation

RAG             Retrieval-Augment Generation
combines retrieval + generation models to surface new relevant data as part of a prompt

RLHF
Reinforcement learning from human feedback
provide model w/ feedback from human evaluators who guide and improve its responses


Pg.23
ICL example
use ICL to train a customer support chatbot on company-specific documents, emails, tech support tickets
hels respond more effectively to Qs about Org products + services


RAG
leverages pretrained language mode in conjunction with large scale vector search system to enhance
content generation process
e.g. failure to recognize facts + events that took place after model was trained

RAG
accesses up-to-date info by retrieving relevant data stored as vectors
[numerical representation of the data for fast retrieval]
e.g.
might use RAG to generate purchase recommendations in a chat by allowing it to retrieve info
on customer state preferences and purchase history enabling more personalized interactions


Pg.24
Fine-tuning Language models
enables you to adapt an LLM to particular tasks by updating parameters of a pretrained model
empowers users to shape LLMs according to their preferences and achieve better results in apps
also
build customized solutions building on top of existing foundation model
rather than training new model from scratch


Pg.25
RLHF
Reinforcement learning from human feedback
form of fine-tuning to guide the learning process and further enhance the performance and behavior of the model
//with the goal of improving its responses over time

IMPORTANT
Many LLM creators use Reinforcement Learning [this technique RLHF] to teach their chatbots to carry on
realistic conversations - such as to engage in dialogue rather than just one-off responses

RLHF benefits
train models to:
- better understand [human] prompts
- generate more humanlike responses
- ensure model aligns w/ your preferences
- minimize risk of harmful content
e.g. train model to avoid toxic language or avoid sensitive topics

IMPORTANT
examples:
Tuning models to learn preferences creates exciting new applications of GenAI technology:
e.g.
Healthcare
leverage patient data and clinical expertise to create personalized treatment plans
resulting in more effective and precise medical interventions

TIP
RLHF import model performance over original pre-trained version


Pg.25
Vector DB
each word mapped to token ID => transformed into a vector
math rep enables efficient storage / retrieval / search of data

Assign unique key to each vector the DB allows for quick + direct access to content
valuable for RAG where rapid retrieval + matching vectors allow model to discover
semantically related text e.g. product customer searched for previously
