Language Models


LLM
Large Language Model

LLaMA
Large Language Model Meta AI
family of LLMs developed by Meta [Facebook]
designed for various language processing tasks e.g text generation, summarization, translation
broader category of LLM which AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand
and generate-human-like-language

NLP
Technology that helps computers understand, interpret, and respond to human language
in a useful and meaningful way


RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation
process of optimizing the output of large language model [LLM]
so it references an authoratative knowledge base outside of its
training data sources before generating a response
