MLOps
integrates key principles and practices of DevOps and ML while addressing the unique challenges of deploying and managing ML models in Prod environment


DevOps
Automation
MLOps extends to automating parts of ML workflow
[data preprocessing, model training, testing, deployment]

Collaboration
MLOps fosters collaboration btwn data scientists, engineers, Ops teams

CI/CD
ML ensuring models continuously integrated, tested, deployed => pipeline


ML
MLOps adds layer of handling models
[training, fine-tuning and versioning]

Data Mgt
data pipelines: ensure data used in training and testing models
is consistent and reliable
ML models depend  on data quality, data drift - continuously monitored

Retrain
MLOps models monitored once deployed to track performance
ensure they remain accurate over time: retrain or update based on new data
or changing environments


SUMMARY
MLOps incorporates DevOps + introduces ML-specific concerns e.g.
managing models, data pipelines, continuous training
focused on the lifecycle of ML models
