Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning
Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning(RLFT) , which represents the future of LLM optimization

a chatbot trained using RLFT can adapt its responses to need the needs of individual users or improve over time based on user satisfaction scores

PPO , a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm

RLFT is the ability to directly incorporate user feedback into the training process
RLFT a powerful tool for optimizing language models for specific tasks and environments

Conclusion
Reinforcement learning fine-tuning is a game-changing method that offers significant improvements over traditional fine-tunning methods for large language models [LLMs]
