obs, rew, done, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())

obs	observation of the environment
rew	reward if your action was beneficial or not
done	indicates success
info	e.g. performance + latency for debugging

action		env.action_space
state		env.observation_space


RL algorithm	Q-learning
Q-learning
lets the agent use the environment's rewards to learn, over time, the best action to take in a given state

IMPORTANT
Deep Reinforcement Learning
relates to when Deep neural networks are used instead of the Q-table in Q-learning

CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks
deep learning technique can be used to interpret pixels

Q-learning
value-based method of supplying information to inform which action an agent should take
