RL
Aligning LLMs w/ human values and preferences

made possible via RLHF
Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback

RLHF
refine a language model behavior based on feedback that
captures what we consider to be good or useful outputs

PPO
Proximal Policy Optimization

RL framework formalized as Markov Decision Process [MDP]
which includes states, actions, rewards, transitions and policy

Assume policy = ML model e.g. deep neural network


EXAMPLE implementation
use an environment from Open AI Gym


import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.distributions.categorical import Categorical
from torch.optim import Adam
import numpy as np
import gym
from gym.spaces import Discrete, Box


EGLP
Expected Grad Log Prob
