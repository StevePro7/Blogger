<u>Retrospectives</u><br />
In Jan-2020 <a href="https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2020/01/retrospective-xi.html">Retrospective XI</a>, we learned about an interesting development connecting Artificial Intelligence and retro video games leveraging Reinforcement Learning.  In Jan-2021 <a href="https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2021/01/retrospective-xii.html">Retrospective XII</a>, we then discussed video games as an interesting field of study and retro game development of Pacman and Doom clones as an excellent avenue to pursue with regards to future applications in software with Artificial Intelligence and RL.
<br /><br />
Consequently, in the previous post, we disovered how to debug step thru cloned versions of Doom to better understand the original source code: an important pre-requisite to extend knowledge for further research in reinforcement learning, in particular.  For example, <a href="https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl">ViZDoom</a> allows developing AI bots that play Doom using visual data.  In 2022, <a href="https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom?tab=readme-ov-file">ViZDoom</a> joined Farama Foundation featuring new <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org">Gymnasium</a> environment wrappers.
<br /><br />

<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, we have now setup Gymnasium environments for Classic Control, Toy Text, Box 2D, MuJo Co and Atari.  NB: all Atari <a href="https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Arcade-Learning-Environment">environments</a> leverage the Atari Arcade Learning Environment [ALE] emulator Stella.
<br /><br />
In fact, reverting back to OpenAI which hosts the <a href="https://github.com/openai/retro">Retro</a> Git source code repository, also including Emulated Systems like Atari.  However, Retro also includes many other Emulated Systems we have developed for in the past including Nintendo GameBoy / GameBoy Color, Sega MegaDrive and or course the Sega Master System!  This will be the topic of the next post.
