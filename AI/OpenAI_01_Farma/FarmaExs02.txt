<b>Classic Control</b><br />
There are five Classic Control environments which are stochastic in terms of initial state within given range.
<br /><br />
<b>Toy Text</b><br />
Toy text environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. They are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.
<br /><br />
<b>Box2D</b><br />
Box2D environments involve toy games based around box2d physics control and PyGame-based rendering.
<br /><br />
<b>MuJoCo</b><br />
MuJoCo [Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact] is physics engine for facilitating research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, also areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed.  
<br /><br />
<b>Atari</b><br />
Atari environments are simulated via the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) through the Stella emulator.
