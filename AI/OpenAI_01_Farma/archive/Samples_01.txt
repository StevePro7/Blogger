First Sample is the Open Lake using the old OpenAI Gym repo

ORG samples

03.
GYM examples
/home/stevepro/GitHub2/Gymnasium/gymnasium
here is where I added examples sub-directory to debug-step thru ALL code samples
however I had to git checkout hash pointing to 0.29.1 as there seem to be breaking change from GitHub repo


Notes on what I did
/home/stevepro/GitHub/StevePro7/Blogger/AI/TheFarmaFoundation/farma_foundation.txt

Basically setup new Python project in PyCharm
touch requirements.txt

Source is from FF repo
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/docs/requirements.txt

NB: the version that I have is older now - obv. been updated
write code to complete the FF sample


pip list | grep gym
/home/stevepro/GitHub/StevePro9/PythonSetup/NewOpenAI/Farma/GymTest01new
0.29.1

I looked up the tag build Git commit hash that was aligned to this version release
in order to get the Atari samples working
