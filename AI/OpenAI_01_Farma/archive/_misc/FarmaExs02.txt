<b>Classic Control</b><br />
There are five <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control">Classic Control</a> environments which are stochastic in terms of initial state within given range.
<br /><br />
<b>Toy Text</b><br />
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text">Toy Text</a> environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. They are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.
<br /><br />
<b>Box2D</b><br />
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d">Box2D</a> environments involve toy games based around box2d physics control and PyGame-based rendering.
<br /><br />
<b>MuJoCo</b><br />
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco">MuJoCo</a> [Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact] is physics engine for facilitating research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, also areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed.  
<br /><br />
<b>Atari</b><br />
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari">Atari</a> environments are simulated via the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) through the Stella emulator.
