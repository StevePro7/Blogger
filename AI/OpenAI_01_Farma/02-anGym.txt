<u>Gym</u><br />
<a href="https://github.com/openai/gym">OpenAI Gym</a> is an open source Python library for developing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing standard API to communicate between algorithms and environments.  Gym soon became widely <a href="https://wandb.ai/mukilan/intro_to_gym/reports/A-Gentle-Introduction-to-OpenAI-Gym--VmlldzozMjg5MTA3">adopted</a> by the community for creating and training algorithms in various environments for AI Reinforcement Learning.   
<br /><br />
Gym provides a wide range of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-differences-gym-gymnasium-environments-learning-sabir-ali">environments</a>, including classic control problems, Atari games, and robotics.  Gym also includes set of tools for monitoring and evaluating performance of reinforcement learning agents.
<br /><br />
GYM Example: CartPole
<br /><br />
GYM Example: Frozen Lake
<br /><br />
YouTube videos online also introduce OpenAI Gym but include Frozen Lake environment and Atari Breakout.
<br /><br />
  There are also YouTube videos that introduce OpenAI Gym setup but using the Frozen Lake environment and Atari Breakout.
<br /><br />

<b>Differences</b><br />
While both Gym and Gymnasium are powerful tools for creating <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-differences-gym-gymnasium-environments-learning-sabir-ali">environments</a> for reinforcement learning, it makes more <a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/41763/should-i-make-my-environment-with-gym-or-gymnasium">sense</a> to prefer Gymnasium going forward as technically future support for Gym there is none.  Note: old <i>import gym</i> <a href="https://www.gymlibrary.dev">documentation</a> is replaced with <i>import gymnasium as gym</i> convention going forward.
