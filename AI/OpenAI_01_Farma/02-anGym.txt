<u>Gymnasium</u><br />
The main problem with Gym was the lack of <a href="https://wandb.ai/mukilan/intro_to_gym/reports/A-Gentle-Introduction-to-OpenAI-Gym--VmlldzozMjg5MTA3">maintenance</a>: OpenAI did not allocate substantial resources for the development of Gym since its inception seven years earlier, and, by2020, it simply was not maintained.
<br /><br />
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org">Gymnasium</a> is a maintained fork of the OpenAI Gym library. The Gymnasium interface is simple, pythonic, and capable of representing general RL problems with a compatibility wrapper for old Gym environments:

<u>Gym</u><br />
<a href="https://github.com/openai/gym">OpenAI Gym</a> is an open source Python library for developing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing standard API to communicate between algorithms and environments.  Gym soon became widely <a href="https://wandb.ai/mukilan/intro_to_gym/reports/A-Gentle-Introduction-to-OpenAI-Gym--VmlldzozMjg5MTA3">adopted</a> by the community for creating and training algorithms in various environments for AI Reinforcement Learning.   
<br /><br />
Gym provides a wide range of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-differences-gym-gymnasium-environments-learning-sabir-ali">environments</a>, including classic control problems, Atari games, and robotics.  Gym also includes set of tools for monitoring and evaluating performance of reinforcement learning agents.

YouTube videos online also introduce OpenAI Gym but include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrro7W7iW2w">Frozen Lake</a> environment and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkDIb8yl69g">Atari Breakout</a>.

<b>Differences</b><br />
While both Gym and Gymnasium are powerful tools for creating <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-differences-gym-gymnasium-environments-learning-sabir-ali">environments</a> for reinforcement learning, it makes more <a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/41763/should-i-make-my-environment-with-gym-or-gymnasium">sense</a> to prefer Gymnasium going forward as technically future support for Gym there is none.  Note: old <i>import gym</i> <a href="https://www.gymlibrary.dev">documentation</a> is replaced with <i>import gymnasium as gym</i> convention going forward.
