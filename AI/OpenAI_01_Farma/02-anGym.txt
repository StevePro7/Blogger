<b>Differences</b><br />
While both Gym and Gymnasium are powerful tools for creating <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-differences-gym-gymnasium-environments-learning-sabir-ali">environments</a> for reinforcement learning, it makes more <a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/41763/should-i-make-my-environment-with-gym-or-gymnasium">sense</a> to prefer Gymnasium going forward as technically future support for Gym there is none.  Note: old <i>import gym</i> <a href="https://www.gymlibrary.dev">documentation</a> is replaced with <i>import gymnasium as gym</i> convention going forward.
