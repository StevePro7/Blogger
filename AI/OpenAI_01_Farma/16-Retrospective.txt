In Jan-2020 Retrospective XI, I learned about a new interesting development connecting Artificial Intelligence and [Retro] Video Games leveraging Reinforcement Learning in Video Games.

In Jan-2021 Retrospective XII, we further discussed video games as an interesting field of study and retro game development of Pacman and Doom clones as an excellent avenue to pursue with regards to future applications in software with Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning.

Consequently, in the previous post, we disovered how to debug step through cloned versions of Doom on Windows and Linux in order to better understand the [original] source code.  This is an important pre-requisite if we would like to extend this knowledge for further research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.  For example VizCoom allows developing AI bots that play Doom using visual information (the screen buffer).  In 2022, VizDoom joined Farama Foundation and feature [OpenAI Gym]/Gymnasium environment wrappers similar to the work done in this blog

ViZDoom allows developing AI bots that play Doom using visual information (the screen buffer). It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.

SUMMARY

Atari Arcade Learning Environment [ALE] emulator Stella
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Arcade-Learning-Environment

e.g.
ALE/MsPacman-v5
ALE/Pacman-v5


seque to Retro games

IMPORTANT

Emulated Systems
Atari
Atari2600 (via Stella)


BUT other retro hardware we have "checked" out in prev yrs
e.g.
SMS, NES, S/MD

NES
N/GB + GBC

Sega
GG
MS
MD
this will be the topic of the next post
