In Jan-2020 Retrospective XI, I learned about a new interesting development connecting Artificial Intelligence and [Retro] Video Games leveraging Reinforcement Learning in Video Games.

In Jan-2021 Retrospective XII, we further discussed video games as an interesting field of study and retro game development of Pacman and Doom clones as an excellent avenue to pursue with regards to future applications in software with Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning.

Consequently, in the previous post, we disovered how to debug step through cloned versions of Doom on Windows and Linux in order to better understand the [original] source code.  This is an important pre-requisite if we would like to extend this knowledge for further research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.  For example ViZDoom allows developing AI bots that play Doom using visual information (the screen buffer).  In 2022, ViZDoom joined Farama Foundation and feature [OpenAI Gym]/Gymnasium environment wrappers similar to the work done in this blog

<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, we have now setup OpenAI Gym and going forward Farama Foundation Gymnasium environments for Classic Control, Toy Text, Box2D, MuJoCo and Atari.  All Atari environments leverage the 
Atari Arcade Learning Environment [ALE] emulator Stella

Stella

for example
ALE/MsPacman-v5
ALE/Pacman-v5

In fact, reverting back to OpenAI hosts the Retro Git source code repository which also includes 
Emulated Systems
Atari
Atari2600 (via Stella)

However, there are also many other Emulated Systems that we have developed for in the past including Nintendo GameBoy / GameBoy Color, [the] Sega MegaDrive [Genesis] and or course the Sega Master System.

BUT other retro hardware we have "checked" out in prev yrs
e.g.
SMS, NES, S/MD
