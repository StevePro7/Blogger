OpenAI is an American Artificial Intelligence [AI] research organization founded Dec-2015 head-quartered in San Francisco.  In April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym": its platform for reinforcement learning research.  Reinforcement Learning [WRL] is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control concerned with how an agent takes action in environment in order to maximize cumulative rewards.

<u>Gym</u><br />
OpenAI Gym soon became widely adopted by the community for creating and training RL algorithms in various environments.  
  
  Gym: developed by OpenAI
one of the most widely used libraries for creating environments for reinforcement learning

Gym provides a wide range of environments, including classic control problems,
Atari games, and robotic environments

  <br><br>
  GYM Example: Frozen Lake
  <br><br> 
  

<u>Gymnasium</u><br />
    The main problem with Gym, however, was the lack of maintenance. OpenAI didn't allocate substantial resources for the development of Gym since its inception seven years earlier, and, by 2020, it simply wasn't maintained. 

Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms

<b>Differences</b><br />
While both Gym and Gymnasium are powerful tools for creating environments for reinforcement learning, it makes more sense to prefer Gymnasium going forward as there is technically no future support for Gym.

  In 2021, a non-profit organization called the Farama Foundation took over Gym.  They introduced new features into Gym, renaming it Gymnasium a library where the future maintenance of OpenAI Gym will take place.
