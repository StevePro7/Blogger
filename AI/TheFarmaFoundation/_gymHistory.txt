GYM History
01-Aug-2024


OpenAI
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI

is an Americal artificial intelligence (AI) research organization 
[founded in December 2015 and]
headquartered in San Francisco

In April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym",
its platform for reinforcement learning research 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL)
is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning]

and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent ought to take
actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize its cumulative rewards

//Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

OpenAI Gym soon became widely adopted by the community for creating and training 
RL algorithms in various environments

The main problem with Gym, however, was the lack of maintenance. OpenAI didn't allocate substantial resources for the development of Gym since its inception seven years earlier, and, by 2020, it simply wasn't maintained. 

In 2021, a non-profit organization called the Farama Foundation took over Gym.  They
introduced new features into Gym, renaming it Gymnasium

Here is the official announcement 25-Oct-2022

Today we’re announcing the Farama Foundation – a new nonprofit organization designed in part to house major existing open source reinforcement learning (“RL”) libraries in a neutral nonprofit body.

including the official release of Gymnasium:
a library where the future maintenance of OpenAI Gym will take place

Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing
reinforcement learning algorithms 

//by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as //well as a standard set of environments complient with that API

FF Gymnasium is a fork of OpenAI's Gym
https://github.com/openai/gym

//Future maintenance will occur here in FF Gymnasium going forward



Q:
Should I make my environment with gym or gymnasium?
https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/41763/should-i-make-my-environment-with-gym-or-gymnasium

A:
As OpenAI Gym is not officially supported [these days] it makes sense to
"adopt" all future development with FF Gymnasium

NB: when you look online you may see a lot of old documentation
import gym

If/when you do then simply update to the following convention adopted by the community
for compatibility
import gymnasium as gym
