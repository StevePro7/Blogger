    observation, info = env.reset()

    for _ in range(1000):
        action = env.action_space.sample()  # agent policy that uses the observation and info
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

        if terminated or truncated:
            observation, info = env.reset()

    env.close()

IMPORTANT
for the first 2x OK - no new packages but
pip install Box2D
pip install muJoCO

Finally, in order to get Atari working I had to checkout the tag
0.29.1
81b87eb

in order to get this working!!

i.e.
there must be breaking code change on latest Gymnasium master
