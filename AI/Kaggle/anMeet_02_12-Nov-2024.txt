I saw mean on some examples but if skew data then maybe choose median
and the max value


Correlation with the Outcome [target]

which feature more close to the outcome?
feature

df.corr()

which features are important?

Feature scaling

Logistic Regression
basic linear test
decision boundary

Diabetes
binary classifier
right   diabetes    1
left    healthy     0


Model
accuracy = not good measure

Confusion matrix
2x2 matric
TN TP       True  Neg   True  Pos
FN FP       False Neg   False Pos


Classification report
Recall vs. Precision
what have predicted
e.g. cancer example
FP      treatment
FN      game over

Recall
Binary classification
taxes example


AUC
Area Under Curve
45 degree line

Area [rule]
max is better


Random Forest
if true else if ...
data structure = tree
Many decision trees working together

Logistic
train model

Train Test evaluation split
Train data
8/10  train
2/10  test

8 into 4

X_train     9x inputs
Y_train     1x outcome  healthy vs. diabetes

X_test      9x inputs
Y_test      1x outcome  of test

y_pred      evaluate( y_test )


Random Forest
lots of parameters to tweak

learning curve
Random Search

grid = randomly get score
e.g.
Accuracy
1000 steps


Logistic Regression
70/30 split
random_state = 42
stratify = y        True
