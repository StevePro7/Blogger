GPT
Precision + Recall
two key metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model
esp. where imbalanced classes or FP or FN have different costs

Precision       positive predictive value
measures how accurate the model's positive predictions are

Recall          sensitivity or true positive rate
measures the model's ability to corretly identify all postive instances in dataset


02. correlation_matrix
df.corr()

Test02.py

GPT
table that shows pair-wise correlation coefficients btwn multiple variables
understand how each variable is related to others in the dataset

- spot redundant features [highly correlated ones] that might not add any new info to the model
- detect multi colinearity which can be problematic for certain models like linear regression

Use seaborn to render heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix to make it
easier to spot high or low correlations

Applications
- exclude features w/ high correlations to avoid redundancy
- relationships may inspire new features
- multicollinearity can destabilize the model in linear regression


03. confusion_matrix
anMeet_02_12--Nov-2024

GPT
table used to evaluate performance of a classification model by comparing
predicted labels to actual labels

breakdown of model's performance across different classes helping identify
types of errors and measure key metrics like accuracy precision recall and F1 score

TP  Predict +ve Actual +ve
TN  Predict -ve Actual -ve
FP  Predict +ve Actual -ve      diagnosed cancer but don't have but have treatment
FN  Predict -ve Actual +ve      not diagnosed cancer but you do have = game over

High TP + TN    indicate model performs well
High FP         model tendency to label -ve as +ve
High FN         model often misses +ve cases


SUMMARY
CSV
Pandas      dataFrame   info about data
Matplot     visualize data
Seaborn     correlation matrix  understand how data is related      df.corr()
sklearn     implement machine learning models
sklearn     train_test_split
sklearn     classification_report   precision vs. recall

NOTE
sklearn     library has many algorithms that can be used to train models
xgboost     library ideal for high-performing model for tabular data
