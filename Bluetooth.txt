Bluetooth
01/01/2024

Today I had weird issue with Bluetooth device connecting to Windows 10 laptop
couldn't connect

and when I went to 
Settings | Bluetooth the Audio Bose NC 700 HP was grayed out
couldn't remove
couldn't add new device etc
weird!

SOLN
Device Manager
Bluetooth
was a small "warning" triangle - not sure how
right click
Remove driver

now all OK
maybe this all started when I updated Alienware couple days ago...??



Reference?
