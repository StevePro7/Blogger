AFTER	UseWUServer 	0

Restart Windows Update service

Settings | Update & Security | For Developers | Developer Mode
now seems to update developer mode OK


Restart PC
Settings will add any additional requirements to enable Developer Mode


02.
Control Panel | Programs and Features | Turn Windows features on or off
Restart PC

Start | run | bash command
Windowe flashes so I assume this is because it is failing and there is no Linux distribution currently installed

Start | run | cmd
Type bash

The same happens on Powershell for commands
bash
cmd


03.
Install Ubuntu
Start | Microsoft Store
search for Ubuntu | Install

After installing Launch
Installing, this may take a few minutes...

After installation complete will be prompted to enter username and password
username	stevepro
password	password		SP4


NB: to relaunch Ubuntu bash
Start | run | Ubuntu


IMPORTANT
When you first start using the bash command prompt from within Windows it may freak you out a bit because of the colors
esp.
cd /mnt/c
ls

Windows files		blue
Windows directories	background color

Linux files		white
Linux directories	blue

There is a thread here about changing the colors
e.g.
.bashrc
