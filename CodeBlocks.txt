Code Blocks
16/05/2020

Here is how I created Code Blocks project file on Linux
to use for the cross platform C++ code from Effective Modern C++ repo

first setup the folder structure for the project you are extending
e.g.
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\EffectiveModernCpp\Chap00_Introduction\00-Intro\Src

Create folders
00-Intro


Launch Linux via Dropbox	Ubuntu 19.10
Launch Code Blocks

File | New | Project...
Console application
C++

Project title			Lin
Folder to create		/home/stevepro/Steven/Temp/00-Intro/Lin
Project filename		Item
Resulting filename		/home/stevepro/Steven/Temp/00-Intro/Lin/Item.cbp

Next
leave all defaults as is

Finish


Finally, copy the Src folder under 00-Intro

back in Code Blocks right click "Lin" project
Add files...
..\Src\Item.cpp

right click original main.cpp
Remove file from project

Build + run
