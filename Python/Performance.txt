Learn how Codon achieves 100x Python speedups through AOT compilation. Native multithreading, GPU kernels, zero overhead.

strange - though says doesn't work so well with C

For my use case: ML research and healthcare AI, Codon is extremely compelling. The performance gains on computational kernels are hard to ignore, and the ability to parallelize without fighting the GIL is huge.

Codon is an independent, compiled programming language with Python-like syntax, designed for high performance — not a Python implementation.

SUMMARY
instead of writing performant code in C/C++ - which has a steeper learning curve - one
could write that code in Codon - as it has Python like syntax and then have Python code
interface with it [Codon]

However, Codon does not currently have its own unit test framework like C++ has gtest
