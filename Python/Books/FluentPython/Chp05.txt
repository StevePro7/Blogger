Data Class Builders

266-323

Data class builders automate the creation of classes primarily used to store data.

collections.namedtuple creates lightweight, immutable tuple subclasses with named fields.

typing.NamedTuple adds type hints to named tuple definitions.

@dataclass generates boilerplate methods like __init__, __repr__, and __eq__.

Data classes reduce repetitive class-writing code.

Fields in a dataclass are defined using type annotations.

Default values can be assigned directly in field definitions.

field() customizes default values and behaviors.

default_factory is used for mutable default values.

Dataclasses can be mutable or frozen (immutable).

frozen=True makes instances hashable when possible.

Field order determines constructor parameter order.

Dataclasses support comparison methods automatically when enabled.

__post_init__ allows additional initialization logic after object creation.

asdict() converts dataclass instances to dictionaries.

astuple() converts dataclass instances to tuples.

Data classes support inheritance.

Named tuples are memory-efficient and iterable like regular tuples.

Dataclasses are more flexible than named tuples for complex models.

Choosing between namedtuple and dataclass depends on mutability and feature needs.

Data class builders encourage clear, declarative domain models.
