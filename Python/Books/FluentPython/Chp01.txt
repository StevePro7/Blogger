Python Data Model
01-Feb-2026

GEN SUM
Python Data Model = PYTHONIC

Python Data Model has Special Methods
e.g.
__len__
__add__
__str__
__repr__

and operator-to-method mappings: len(), abs()

By implementing Special Methods you can make custom objects
behave like built-in objects

Example: FrenchDeck
which implements sequence Special Methods
__len__
__getitem__

this makes the custom object FrenchDeck behave like a built-in
sequence which enables iteration, indexing, slicing and library interop


Chp01 then talks about 
- doctest = used a lot throughout book
- Vector custom object with more Special Methods implemented
  e.g. __repr__

- collection API
- overview of Special Methods

Chp01 ends
Python Data Model = language metaobject protocol [object model]
that defines how core behaviors [attribute access, operators, iterators]
are exposed and extended


21.
Python = consistency

Pythonic = Python data model

22
data model
description of Python framework:
sequences, functions, iterators, coroutines, classes, context managers

special methods = dunder methods    [double underscore]

23 .NEW
async programming

24. Pythonic Card Deck
Ex1-1
__getitem__
__len__
namedtuple
bundle of attributes with no custom methods = DB reord

__getitem__
deck
- supports slicing
- iterable
- iterate reversed
- sorted

27.
Composition __len__ and __getitem__
implementations can delegate all work to list

28.
special methods
e.g. __len__

you don't call      my_object.__len__()
you call            len(my_object)
only one you call   __init__()


29. Emulating types
Vector class implements
__repr__            REPL
__abs__
__add__
__mul__

NB:
!r      = representation

Python interpreter frequent caller of special methods
you call
+       P/I __add__
*       P/I __mul__

NB: infix operators
create new objects - do not touch operands

33. !r
f-string __repr__ uses !r   good practice
get
Vector(1, 2)
NOT
Vector('1', '2')

__str__         used by print statement

NB: toString()
use __repr__ rather than __str__

35. bool
truthy OR falsey
bool(x) = True OR False

35. Collection API
important collectin interfaces

Collection ABC
3x interfaces
1. Iterable
2. Sized
3. Contains     in operator

3x Collection specializations
1. Sequence     list, str
2. Mapping      dict, defaultdict
3. Set          set, frozenset


39. Overview of Special methods
async methods	anext

41. categories of method names

42. @ = infix operator	matrix multiplication

44.
__radd__        r   reversed
__iadd__        i   in-place

45. reversed operator = special method
e.g.
a += b

len() NOT a method because NO method is called for
built-in objects of CPython
len = read a field from C struct
i.e.
unary operator			like abs()


47. SUMMARY
implement special methods = objects behave like built-in types
i.e.
Pythonic

Data Model = Python object has
__str__			string rep for debug + logging
__repr__		string rep to users

e.g.
FrenchDeck
special methods
__len__
__getitem__

Remaining special methods of Python Data Model covered in rest of book


47. augmented operator
a += b


49. Soapbox
Python Data Model special methods
NOT
Python object model

defined by the metaobject protocol

50. AMOP		Art of the Metaobject Protocol
metaobject		objects part of building blocks of language
protocol		synonym for interface

metaobject protocol
fancy for object model = API for core language constructs

AOP
Aspect-Orientated Programming
easier for dynamic languages like Python
frameworks like zope.interface
