Text Versus Bytes
202-265

Python 3 clearly separates text (str) from binary data (bytes).

str represents Unicode text, not raw bytes.

bytes represents immutable sequences of 8-bit values.

bytearray is a mutable version of bytes.

Text must be encoded to become bytes.

Bytes must be decoded to become text.

Encoding converts Unicode code points into byte sequences.

UTF-8 is the dominant and recommended default encoding.

Never assume a system’s default encoding—always specify it explicitly.

Encoding errors raise UnicodeEncodeError.

Decoding errors raise UnicodeDecodeError.

Error-handling strategies include strict, ignore, and replace.

A code point is not the same as its encoded byte representation.

Characters may occupy multiple bytes in UTF-8.

The length of a string differs from the length of its encoded bytes.

Text files should be opened with an explicit encoding argument.

Binary files must be opened in binary mode ('rb' / 'wb').

Python source files default to UTF-8 encoding.

Byte literals use the b'' prefix.

Bytes and bytearray support most sequence operations.

The memoryview object allows zero-copy slicing of binary data.

Unicode normalization ensures consistent representation of equivalent text.

Case folding is stronger than lowercasing for Unicode comparisons.

Always handle text at the boundaries of your program (I/O), not internally as bytes.
