Design Patterns with First-Class Functions
505-531

First-class functions allow classic design patterns to be implemented more simply in Python.

The Strategy pattern can be implemented using functions instead of classes.

Passing a function as an argument replaces the need for strategy subclasses.

Functions reduce boilerplate compared to class-based pattern implementations.

The Command pattern can be represented by callable objects or plain functions.

Replacing conditionals with a dictionary of functions improves extensibility.

Functions stored in data structures enable dynamic behavior selection.

Higher-order functions simplify behavior parameterization.

Closures allow strategies to maintain internal state when needed.

The Template Method pattern can often be replaced with higher-order functions.

Callbacks are natural applications of first-class functions.

Using functions encourages composition over inheritance.

Polymorphism in Python is often achieved without formal class hierarchies.

Decorators provide a functional alternative to certain structural patterns.

First-class functions promote flexible and modular design.

Behavior can be selected at runtime without subclassing.

Refactoring to functions often improves readability and maintainability.

Python’s dynamic nature makes some GoF patterns less necessary.

Simpler function-based solutions often outperform complex OO implementations.

Understanding first-class functions reshapes how design patterns are applied in Python.
