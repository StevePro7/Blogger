Type Hints in Functions
388-455


Type hints document the expected types of function parameters and return values.

Type hints are optional and do not affect runtime behavior by default.

Static type checkers (e.g., mypy) analyze code using annotations.

Function annotations are stored in the __annotations__ attribute.

Parameter types are declared after the parameter name using :.

Return types are declared using -> in the function signature.

Built-in collection types can be parameterized (e.g., list[int]).

typing.Any disables type checking for a specific value.

typing.Union expresses multiple acceptable types.

The | operator provides a modern syntax for unions (e.g., int | str).

typing.Optional[T] is shorthand for T | None.

typing.Sequence and other abstract types support flexible APIs.

Use abstract collection types in annotations for generality.

typing.Callable annotates function parameters that accept callables.

Type variables (TypeVar) enable generic function definitions.

Constrained type variables restrict acceptable types.

Overloaded functions can be expressed using @overload.

typing.Protocol supports structural subtyping (duck typing with types).

Forward references allow types not yet defined to be annotated as strings.

Type hints improve readability, tooling, and maintainability.

Gradual typing allows mixing typed and untyped code safely.
