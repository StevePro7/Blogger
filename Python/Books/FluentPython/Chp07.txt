Functions as First-Class Objects
361-388


Functions in Python are first-class objects that can be assigned to variables.

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

Functions can be returned as values from other functions.

A function object has attributes such as __name__ and __doc__.

Higher-order functions accept or return other functions.

map(), filter(), and reduce() operate on iterables using functions.

List comprehensions often replace map() and filter() more readably.

Anonymous functions are created with the lambda keyword.

Lambdas are limited to single expressions.

The sorted() function accepts a key function for custom ordering.

Callable objects are any objects implementing __call__.

Classes can behave like functions by defining __call__.

User-defined callables enable stateful function-like objects.

Functions have introspection attributes accessible via dir() and __dict__.

The __annotations__ attribute stores type hints.

The inspect module reveals function signatures.

Positional-only and keyword-only parameters control function APIs.

Variable positional arguments use *args.

Variable keyword arguments use **kwargs.

Functions support default parameter values.

First-class functions enable flexible, composable program design.
