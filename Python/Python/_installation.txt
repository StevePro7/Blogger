Intro
What is Python

Why is Pyhon so popular / fastest growing language in popularity
e.g.
ML + DS

cross platform 
all examples should work on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux

Python2	deprecated
Python3	always use this!

pip
Python Installer Package


Test python is pre-installed
launch terminal
python
python3

which python
python --version
always default Python to Python3
for this blog e.g Python3.7

install Python on
Windows
MacOS + Linux should be pre-installed

ensure default for Python is Python3.7 NOT Python2.7
instructions on how to do thiis!!


Since Python used heavily in DS we will actually download + install Anaconda version
of Python + Pip etc. because ANA [or conda] has numerous ML Python libraries + packages installedc by default also

instructions on how to install conda on
WinPC
MacOS
Linux

all setup for Python3.7


IDE
Install PyCharm IDE community edition on all 3x OS's
use PyCharm for blog01 with general Python learning

and then use VS Code for ML blog02
connect to remote Linux VM
Docker + Kubernetes Flask ML application??



SUMMARY
blog 01
we did all this post Python 3.7 but 3.8 has more stuff
e.g.
However, ues generic Python coding to investigate more ML, DS + AI
topic of next post

blog 02
did all ML coding in VS Code [Linux VM] for this one + Jupyter notebooks via VS Code
but these are often Flask applications and popular deployment: Docker + Kubernetes
need to investigate this more in future but mention
Docker you're doing it wrong as VS Code extension plugin as great place to start
and con't ML via Python but containize applications for streamlined deployment + scaling
[orchestration + scheduling]
