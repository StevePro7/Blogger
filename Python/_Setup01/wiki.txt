Python is an interpreted high-level and general purpose programming language.  Python 2.0 was released in 2000 but officially discontinued in 2020.  Python 3.x is now the preferred version for most projects e.g. v3.7.
<br /><br />
Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn.  There is also open source Python distribution Anaconda used for data science and machine learning applications that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
