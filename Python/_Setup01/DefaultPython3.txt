Launch Ubuntu Linux
Terminal

BEFORE
python	defaults to python2.7
pip	not found

python3	defaults to python3.8
pip3	pip 20.07

alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
source ~/.bashrc


Restart but didn't work


Try this
sudo apt-get install python-is-python3

works for python but not pip
python	python3
pip	not found


Try this
just update the ~/.bashrc file

echo "alias python=python3" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias pip=pip3" >> ~/.bashrc
