Visual Studio
21/04/2020

SUMMARY
tried this again and for 3rd party packages
e.g.
Pygame
Numpy
Tensorflow
etc.


just cannot seem to get Intellisense working at all!
just will not work

However, did seem to recognize intellisense for local classes however

IT worked for VS2017
tl;dr;

Install VS2017
Check Python option

Install Visual Studio IntelliCode
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.VSIntelliCode

NB: for VS2017 only - don't think there is alternative version for VS2019

Launch VS2017
Start | New Project | Python | Python Application


Install any modules that you don't have installed
Can install this via the command prompt but was not being detected by VS2017...??

Therefore
Right click Python 3.7 (global default)
Install Python package...
numpy


Type the following:
inport numpy as np
np.

Hit Ctrl+Space to prompt the intellisense drop down...!



C:\Bitbucket\SteveProXNA\actionstuff\Python
C:\Bitbucket\SteveProXNA\actionstuff\INSTALL\Python


01.
First would have already installed Visual Studio 2019


02.
But install Python for Windows 3.7
Start here:
C:\Bitbucket\SteveProXNA\actionstuff\INSTALL\Python


OR type
Start | run | cmd | python and should prompt to install Python from the Microsoft Store


Ensure that you install PIP


VS2019
New Python Application

Python interpreter detected so simply Hello World projects should work OK

but this will fail
import numpy as np
No module named 'numpy'


SUGGESTION
https://thusithamabotuwana.wordpress.com/2015/07/06/using-visual-studio-2013-for-python-3-4-with-numpy-and-scipy-on-windows
https://pypi.org/project/numpy

Start | run | cmd
pip install numpy

Refresh VS2019 Python Environment
now can see numpy listed in the packages


However NO intellisense
