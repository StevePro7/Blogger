//What is Monkeypatching and Why Use It?
//Monkeypatching is a technique used to modify code behavior at runtime, particularly useful in testing scenarios where certain dependencies or global settings make //it challenging to isolate functionality.

//The monkeypatch fixture in Pytest allows you to safely and temporarily alter attributes, environment variables, dictionary values, or even system paths for testing purposes.

//Monkeypatching ensures that you can mock or replace these dependencies without affecting other parts of your application.


//Monkeypatching Environment Variables
//monkeypatch.setenv("APP_MODE", "Production")
//monkeypatch.delenv("APP_MODE", raising=False)
