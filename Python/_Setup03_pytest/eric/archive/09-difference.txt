//What is the Difference Between Mock and Patch?
//In the context of PyTest and unit testing in Python, mock and patch are tools for simulating or replacing parts of your code during testing.
//Mock: A Mock is a standalone object used to simulate the behaviour of functions or objects. It allows you to set up specific behaviours for method calls, like returning values or raising exceptions.
//Patch: patch is a context manager or decorator that temporarily replaces a function or object with a mock during a test. Itâ€™s particularly handy for mocking external dependencies.
