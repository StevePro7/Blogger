Therefore, clean unit tests should be written F.I.R.S.T:
Fast
Independent
Repeatable
Self-validating
Timely

Tests should be fast
Tests should not depend on each other
Tests should be repeatable in any environment
Tests should have a Boolean output: either they pass or fail
Tests should be written in a timely fashion

You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail
You may not write more production code than is sufficient to make the failing unit test pass
