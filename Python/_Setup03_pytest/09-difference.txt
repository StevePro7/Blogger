<u>Difference</u><br />
In pytest, mock and patch are both <a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/mocking/python-magicmock-raise-exception/#What-is-the-Difference-Between-Mock-and-Patch">tools</a> for simulating or replacing parts of your code during testing.  Mock creates mock objects while patch temporarily replaces real objects with mocks during tests to isolate code + control its behavior.
