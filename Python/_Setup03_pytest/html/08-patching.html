<u>Patching</u><br />
<a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/mocking/pytest-common-mocking-problems/#Mock-and-Patch-%E2%80%94-A-Brief-Recap">Patching</a> is technique that temporarily replaces real objects in code with mock objects during test execution.  <a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/mocking/mocking-vs-patching/#Understanding-Patching-How-It-Works">Patching</a> helps ensure external systems do not affect test outcomes thus tests are consistent and repeatable.
<br /><br />
IMPORTANT - Mocks are <b>NOT</b> stubs!<br />
When we combine <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch">@patch</a> decorator with <i>return_value</i> or <i>side_effect</i> it is a stub but from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">mock</a> package!
