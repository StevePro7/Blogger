<u>Fixtures</u><br />
<a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/fixtures/pytest-fixtures">Fixtures</a> are methods in pytest that provide fixed baseline for tests to run.  Fixtures can be used to <a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/pytest-best-practices/pytest-setup-teardown/#What-is-Setup-and-Teardown">setup</a> all preconditions for tests, provide data, or perform <a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/pytest-best-practices/pytest-setup-teardown/#What-is-Setup-and-Teardown">teardown</a> after tests finished via @pytest.fixture decorator.
<br /><br /> 
<i>01-Scope</i><br />
Fixtures have scope: Function, Class, Module + Session which define how long fixture available during test:
<br />
<!--
<table width="99%" border="1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;<b>SCOPE</b></td><td>&nbsp;<b>DESCRIPTION</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Function</td><td>&nbsp;Fixture created once per test function and destroyed at end of test function</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Class</td><td>&nbsp;Fixture created once per test class and destroyed at the end of test class</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Module</td><td>&nbsp;Fixture created once per test module and destroyed at end of test module</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Session</td><td>&nbsp;Fixture created once per test session and destroyed at end of test session</td></tr>
</table>
-->
<br />
<i>02-conftest</i><br />
In pytest, <a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/pytest-best-practices/pytest-conftest">conftest.py</a> file is used to share fixtures across multiple tests.  All the fixtures in conftest.py will be automagically detected without needing to import.  conftest: typically scoped at test root directory structure.
<br /><br />
<i>03-Dependencies</i><br />
Dependency Injection: when fixtures are requested by other fixtures although this adds complexity to tests!
<br /><br />
<i>04-autouse</i><br />
Simple trick to avoid defining fixture in each test: use the <b><a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/fixtures/pytest-fixture-autouse">autouse</a>=True</b> flag to apply fixture to all tests.
<br /><br />
<i>05-yield</i><br />
When you use <a href="https://pytest-with-eric.com/fixtures/pytest-fixtures/#Yield-vs-Return-in-Fixtures">yield</a> in fixture function setup code executes before yield and teardown executes after yield: 
<br />
<!--  
<table width="99%" border="1">
<tr><td>
<pre style="font-size: 12px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;import pytest  
&nbsp;&nbsp;@pytest.fixture
&nbsp;&nbsp;def my_fixture(): 
&nbsp;&nbsp;    # setup code
&nbsp;&nbsp;    yield "fixture value"
&nbsp;&nbsp;    # teardown code
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
