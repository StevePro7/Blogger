set python.pythonPath to Anaconda in user settings.json
/Anacoda3/bin/python


but VS Code does not seem to recognize this
however can Ctrl + Shift + P to select Python interpreter
although does NOT create workspace settings.json file

Therefore, simply Ctrl + Shift + P to select Python interpreter
on Linux and be done with it

other platforms Win + Mac 
Ctrl + Shift + P to select Python interpreter
creates workspace settings.json file but we don't want to check in to source control

therefore
Win	leave global user settings.json python interpreter
Mac	check global user settings.json python interpreter
