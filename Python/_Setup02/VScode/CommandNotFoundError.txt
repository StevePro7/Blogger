Run simple Python script in VS Code with Anaconda on Window10
but get the error

CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.
If using 'conda activate' from a batch script, change your
invocation to 'CALL conda.bat activate'.


VS Code runs the script but then always tries to activate conda but fails
$ conda activate base

CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.
If using 'conda activate' from a batch script, change your
invocation to 'CALL conda.bat activate'.


SOLUTION
here is how I magically solved this problem...!!


Terminal
Click "+" to create new terminal
default "Conda"

F5 to debug script OR Ctrl+F5 to run script and now works OK without error!!
