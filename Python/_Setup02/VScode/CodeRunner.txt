CodeRunner

settings.json
C:\Users\TEST.000\AppData\Roaming\Code\User


Initially, I couldn't get Code Runner working on Windows10
Ctrl + Shift + N

but the problem was that I had an incorrect entry in settings.json
"code-runner.executorMap":

python3.exe is the PROBLEM
change this to python.exe and all good...!!

        "python": "python3.exe",
        "python.pythonPath": "C:\\Users\\TEST.000\\Anaconda3",
    },
