CodeRunner
13/07/2020


settings.json
C:\Users\TEST.000\AppData\Roaming\Code\User


Initially, I couldn't get Code Runner working on Windows10
Ctrl + Shift + N

but the problem was that I had an incorrect entry in settings.json
"code-runner.executorMap":

python3.exe is the PROBLEM
change this to python.exe and all good...!!


OLD
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
        "python": "python3.exe",
        "python.pythonPath": "C:\\Users\\TEST.000\\Anaconda3",
    },


NEW
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
        "python": "python.exe",
        "python.pythonPath": "C:\\Users\\TEST.000\\Anaconda3",
    },


IMPORTANT
I don't think that I have this configuration on the Mac OS/X

settings.json
~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/

copy + paste the same configuration from Linux
    "python.pythonPath": "%USERPROFILE%/Anaconda3/python.exe",
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
        "python": "python.exe",
        "python.pythonPath": "%USERPROFILE%/Anaconda3",
    },
