Was trying to setup and run examples of ML on Linux
e.g.
D:\Bitbucket\SteveProXNA\actionstuff\Python\ML


I setup requirements.txt
but when tried to install tensorflow

I got error:
python -m pip install tensorflow errno 28 no space left on device

Reference
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/error-out-of-space-while-installing-tensorflow/128736/5

If I have the turns out the same error then this is not disk but RAM issue
i.e.
tensorflow huge and tries to download all into RAM

recommend
export TMPDIR=/some_directory_plenty_space/
