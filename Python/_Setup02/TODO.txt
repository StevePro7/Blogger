SUMMARY
I can do long import and Run / Debug unit tests works but can't F5
or Code Runner Ctrl + Alt + N to debug step thru code this way

Fixed some bugs today so I need to remember:

01.
udpate code samples with [local] workspace "settings.json" file to NOT have 
"python.pythonPath":

because I think it is better to default to [global] user "settings.json"
and leave rather than try to version control because I don't think this setting
can be overridden per platform


02.
Mention Windows10 and Anaconda default Python interpreter
but ensure that the Terminal is "conda" otherwise may get
CommandNotFoundError

e.g.
CommandNotFoundError.txt
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\Blogger\Python\_Setup02\VScode


03.
Code Runner
must update how I got this working on Windows 10
i.e.
[global] user "settings.json"
"python": "python.exe",

NOT
"python": "python3.exe",


03b.
replicate the similar configuration on the Mac OS/X

Was trying to setup and run examples of ML on Linux
e.g.
D:\Bitbucket\SteveProXNA\actionstuff\Python\ML


I setup requirements.txt
but when tried to install tensorflow

I got error:
python -m pip install tensorflow errno 28 no space left on device

Reference
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/error-out-of-space-while-installing-tensorflow/128736/5

If I have the turns out the same error then this is not disk but RAM issue
i.e.
tensorflow huge and tries to download all into RAM

recommend
export TMPDIR=/some_directory_plenty_space/
