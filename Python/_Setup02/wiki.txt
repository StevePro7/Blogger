<u>Install VS Code</u><br />
VS Code is an integrated development environment with useful plugins for Python and Data Science.  Install VS Code from Anaconda navigator.  Otherwise install VS Code for Windows and Mac OS/X and Linux directly.
<br /><br />
Launch VS Code.  Install Python extension for Visual Studio Code.  Install other plugins for example Remote SSH to connect to Linux VM or Code Runner.  Install VS Code Insiders to try pre-release version of VS Code.
