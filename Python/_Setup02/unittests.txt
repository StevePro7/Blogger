unit tests
14/07/2020


Launch VS Code
Terminal
cd E:\Azure\Galileo-driver
pip install driver/.
python -m unittest discover driver


Originally:
Ran 0 test in 0.000s


The issue was that I did NOT have __init__.py
file in one of the directories!!


Reference:

After I sorted this out it worked:

python -m unittest discover driver
Ran 1 test in 0.000s


Also can now discover unit tests
e.g.
Ctrl + Shift + P
Python: Discover Unit Tests

and now there are decorators
Run Test
Debug Test


But when I look up module I still get 

ModuleNotFound error
from driver.task.core._task import MyFoo


Is this because I have PYTHONPATH setup?

IMPORTANT
Have I cracked it?

PyCharm
Launch PyCharm
open E:\Azure2\Galileo-driver

Terminal
cd E:\Azure2\Galileo-driver
pip install driver/.
python -m unittest discover driver



Output
Python Test Log

Alt + Left
to go back


Finally tried the relative path
from ..._factory import load_task

but getting error
Exception has occurred: ImportError
attempted relative import with no known parent package
