User 		settings.json	GLOBAL
%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
~/.config/Code/User/settings.json


Workspace	settings.json	LOCAL


"python.pythonPath": "${env:WORKSPACE_FOLDER}",

I think this is wrong because when I delete Win + Mac use the correct global
user settings.json
Linux seems to not care


Preferences | Settings
${workspaceFolder}/.env


How to display values

Apparently this works which is what I have

IMPORTANT
reference

So I think my best bet is to remove local "python.pythonPath" in workspace settings.json file and use global user settings.json
