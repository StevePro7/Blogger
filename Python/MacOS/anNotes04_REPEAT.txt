PyCharm keyboard shortcuts
so what works well:
TextEdit
PyCharm

but lots still "mixed" up
and cannot install Alt+Tab


Revert iMac back to "normal" - here's what we have
NB: removed Alt+Tab

01. Alt+Tab
Windows key on keyboard = Option key on Mac keyboard
Windows + tab   = Option + tab  = Alt + tab on Windows

02. Ctrl+Tab
Ctrl + Tab  browser     works out-of-the-box!
Ctrl + Tab  PyCharm     works out-of-the-box but if you hit up/down arrows then Mission Control takes over
disable Mission control Ctrl+ up/down
TODO - take screen shot of this first!
System Preferences | Mission Control
Mission Control         -   -
Application windows     -   -
Show Desktop            -   -


TESTING
01.
System Prefs | Keyboard | Modifier keys
Restore defaults
Option Key      Command
now I get Alt+Tab functionality
Ctrl+tab still works


TODO in PyCharm
Alt+Left arrow  go back


DONE
//On the Mac laptop currently have:
//01. Keyboard | Modifier keys
//Control		Command
//Command		Control
//
//02.  10-DefaultKeyBinding_16_GOOD.dict
//~/Library/KeyBindings

//03. Home/End etc
//None of these keys work now
//Ctrl+Home           Ctrl+End
//Ctrl+Left           Ctrl+Right
//Ctrl+Shift+Home     Ctrl+Shift+End
//CtrlShift++Left     CtrlShift++Right
//Shift+Home          Shift+End
//
//NB: some applications Home/End work but others don't

//DONE
//Ctrl keys not working   i.e. use Cmd instead
//which is the Windows key on keyboard    so is this Option
//Ctrl A	select all
//Ctrl X	cut
//Ctrl C	copy
//Ctrl V	paste
//Ctrl S	save
//Ctrl W	close window


//02. Can I swap Cmd for Ctrl?
//Yes
//Control Key     Command
//but Ctrl+Tab now breaks
//and all 3x are Command
//
//Option Key      Command
//Control Key     Command
//Command Key     Command
