Python script = file run directly whereas module like library intended to be imported and used

__new__		creates the object returning the instance
__init__	initializes the object after it's created

Decorator
Python function that modifies behavior or another function [or class] using @decorator syntax

Descriptor
Python object that defines __get__() __set__() or __delete__()	manage attribute access

Dataclass	class primarily used for storing data w/ __init__(), __repr__(), __eq__()
Metaclass	class of a class - defines how class created and customizes creation

Callable	__call__() allows objects to behave and be invoked like functions
lambda		anonymous function [multiple args] execute single expression	[statement]

List comprehension	concise way to create lists in a single line of code
Generator comprehension	similar but produces one value at a time	memory efficient

Iterator
object that returns one element at a time from a collection	__iter__() and __next__()

Generator
special type of iterator that returns one value at a time lazily using yield keyword

Context Manager
object that defines methods to setup and tear down a resource using the "with" statement
__enter__() and __exit__()

GIL
mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time
[limiting true parallelism in multi-thread programs]

Coroutine
special function used in asynchronous programming defined with async that can pause and 
resume execution using await

asyncio		concurrent I/O bound tasks	single thread w/ non-blocking async/await syntax
multithreading	multiple OS threads for concurrency but [GIL] only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time

multiprocessing	Python uses multiple processes eeach with own Python interpreter for parallelism
		ProcessPoolExecutor vs. ThreadPoolExecutor for legacy packages not support async/await

foo()		public
_foo		protected
__foo		private

Memory
reference counting	each object in memory has reference to track = when zero object is deleted
garbage collection	component that checks for objects no longer in use and frees their memory
