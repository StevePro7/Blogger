Retro Setup
31-Jan-2026

Q.
I have git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro this repo has C/C++ code and Python bound by pybind11 When the repo builds the C++ code to be consumed by Python - does it use setup.py?

A.
Short answer: yes — ultimately it uses setup.py, but setup.py delegates the C/C++ build to CMake.

setup.py
pip install .
pip install -e .
python setup.py build


setup.py does not compile C++ directly
This is the modern “best practice” for non-trivial C++ projects.

pybind11 is used inside CMake
pybind11 appears in the CMakeLists.txt, not directly in setup.py.

find_package(pybind11 REQUIRED)
pybind11_add_module(retro_cpp ...)


pip install .
setup.py
custom build_ext
cmake configure
cmake build (uses pybind11)
C++ → Python extension (.so)
installed into site-packages

NB: my notes
pip install -e .
https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2024/11


It uses the Python interpreter that runs setup.py.
python3.8 -m pip install .
python3.10 -m pip install .

As I didn't specify version - I am guessing that's why default to
Python 3.8.10

Q.
Why they don’t compile directly in setup.py

A.
The C++ codebase is large
Cross-platform support matters
pybind11 + CMake gives:
- cleaner dependency handling
- better compiler support
- easier debugging

This is exactly how projects like:
PyTorch
OpenCV
