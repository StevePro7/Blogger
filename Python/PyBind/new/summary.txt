<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, we have demonstrated various PyBind examples in which C++ library code is consumed by a single Python API exclusively.  However, in future there may be instances in which the C++ library may need to be consumed by multiple languages.  In this case <b>ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary()</b> may be better that PyBind!
