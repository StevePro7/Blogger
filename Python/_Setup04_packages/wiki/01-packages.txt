Pip, short for “Pip Installs Packages,”	
Python Package Index (PyPI) – the central hub for Python software

Python Packaging Authority (PyPA),
group dedicated to maintaining core Python packaging software, 

newer tools like uv often prioritize compatibility with Pip’s workflow

pip			installation
venv virtualenv		virtual environments
requirements.txt	listing dependencies	[not true lock file]
setuptools		building packages


Poetry
pyproject.toml
central hub for all project configuration incl. dependencies
standardized more expressive project file

unifies these functions into one cohesive toolchain
virtual environment management, dependency resolution, package building, and publishing, 


uv
Python package installer + resolver + drop-in replacement for Pip

uv venv			virtual environment mgt
uv python install	Python version mgt
uv pip install		Pip compatibility
uvx			Python packagesCLI

uv
fetch metadata from wheel [WHL] file rather than download entire package


Lockfiles
ensure same reproducible builds
uv = platform independent lockfiles


Pip
setuptools		project scaffolding
build			build package distributions [wheel + source]
publish to PyPI		twine


Poetry
poetry new		project scaffolding
poetry add		dependency mgt
poetry build		create distributable packages
poetry publish		upload packages


uv
uv init			project scaffolding
uv add			dependency mgt
uv build		create distributable packages
uv publish		upload packages
