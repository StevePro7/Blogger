Pip, short for “Pip Installs Packages,”	
Python Package Index (PyPI) – the central hub for Python software

Python Packaging Authority (PyPA),
group dedicated to maintaining core Python packaging software, 

newer tools like uv often prioritize compatibility with Pip’s workflow

pip			installation
venv virtualenv		virtual environments
requirements.txt	listing dependencies	[not true lock file]
setuptools		building packages


Poetry
pyproject.toml
central hub for all project configuration incl. dependencies

unifies these functions into one cohesive toolchain
virtual environment management, dependency resolution, package building, and publishing, 


uv
Python package installer + resolver + drop-in replacement for Pip

uv venv			virtual environment mgt
uv python install	Python version mgt
uv pip install		Pip compatibility
uvx			Python packagesCLI
