most pure Python projects use uv to manage everything
uv_build as build backend

hatchling
need custom build steps, advanced file selection OR
VCS-driven versions

poetry-core
shop native extensions [C/C++, Rust]
e.g. 
scikit-build-core	C/C++
OR
maturin			Rust


Frontend
CLI you run
uv
pip
hatch


Backend
