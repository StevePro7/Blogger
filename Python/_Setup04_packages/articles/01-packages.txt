Navigating the Python Packaging Landscape: Pip vs. Poetry vs. uv — A Developer’s Guide
https://dimasyotama.medium.com/navigating-the-python-packaging-landscape-pip-vs-poetry-vs-uv-a-developers-guide-49a9c93caf9c


Pip: The Veteran Standard-Bearer
Pip, short for "Pip Installs Packages"


(PyPI)	Python Package Index 
the central hub for Python software

(PyPA)	Python Packaging Authority
group dedicated to maintaining core Python packaging software

Pip isn't just a utility; it's a fundamental part of Python's development culture.


Project Scaffolding	No				Yes (poetry new)		Yes (uv init)
Building Packages	Relies on setuptools/build	Integrated (poetry build)	Integrated (uv build)
Publishing Packages	Relies on twine			Integrated (poetry publish)	Integrated (uv publish)


Solving the Puzzle: Dependency Resolution
UV
A key optimization is that uv can fetch just the metadata file from a package (wheel) initially, rather than downloading the entire package as Pip often does


Locking it Down: Lockfiles and Reproducibility
Lockfiles are the key.

Poetry
When poetry install runs, Poetry uses this lockfile to recreate the exact environment, ensuring high fidelity.

uv
uv pip compile (similar to pip-tools) can produce a locked requirements.txt from an input file
uv pip sync command then efficiently installs dependencies strictly from this lockfile
uv pip compile --universal


Isolated Worlds: Virtual Environment Management

Poetry
poetry install
Poetry automatically creates an environment if one isn't active

poetry run <command>
execute within this managed environment


From Start to Finish: Project Lifecycle Management

poetry
poetry new					for scaffolding ;
poetry add, poetry remove, and poetry update 	for dependency management ; 
poetry build 					for creating distributable packages ; and 
poetry publish 					for uploading them. 
All project metadata and configurations live in pyproject.toml

uv
uv init 					for scaffolding ; 
uv add, uv remove, and uv sync 			for dependencies ; 
uv build 					for creating packages ; and 
uv publish 					for uploading them. 
Additionally, uv run executes scripts within the project's managed environment


Poetry has its own build backend (poetry-core), while uv's uv build acts as a frontend, respecting the build-backend specified in pyproject.toml
