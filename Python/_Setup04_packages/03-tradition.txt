Virtual Environment<br />
A virtual environment isolates Python project interpreter and installed packages from the system and other Python projects which means each project should have its own environment, its version and dependencies.
<br /><br />
Create a virtual environment in the traditional way using python and pip then activate virtual environment:
<br /><br />
python -m venv .venv
  <br>
Linux: source .venv/bin/activate<br>
Mac OS/X: source .venv/bin/activate<br>
Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
<br /><br />
Next, install packages using python, pip and requirements.txt OR poetry with pyproject.toml configuration:
<br />
Brittle and/or slow [transitive] dependency resolution!
