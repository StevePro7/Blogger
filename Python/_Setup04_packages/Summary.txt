<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, uv has been pitched "One Tool for Everything" as <b>uv</b> replaces pip, virtualenv, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine and is fast at every step.  However, this has only scratched the surface as uv integrates well with other tools for fast reproducible Python workflows such as direnv, pre-commit hooks, pdm + more!
<br /><br />
uv handles Python installs, environment creation and dependency resolution and locking
  <br>
direnv evaluates .envrc to manage environment variables automatically applied to shell session
  <br>
  pdm Python project manager to orchestrate workflows + provide unified tooling to build version and publish pacakges
