<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, uv has been <a href="https://medium.com/codecodecode/uv-virtualenv-direnv-a-fast-reproducible-python-workflow-with-envrc-36da47ce1f4b">pitched</a> "One Tool for Everything" as uv <b>replaces</b> pip, virtualenv, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine and is fast at every step.  However, this has only scratched the surface as uv integrates well with other tools for fast reproducible Python workflows such as direnv, pre-commit hooks, pdm + more!
