UV<br />
Replicating Poetry with more deterministic builds using using pyproject.toml configuration and lock file, UV is built in Rust by Astral as a full rethinking of Python packaging designed for speed and simplicity.  UV: pitched as "A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv and more".  Here is a detailed article comparing the Python Packaging Landscape: Pip vs. Poetry vs. UV from a developer's standpoint.
