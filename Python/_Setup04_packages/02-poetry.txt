<u>History</u><br />
Python Setup Cheat Sheet detailed how to install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)">pip</a> as the de facto standard package-management system on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux.  However, requirements.txt does not lock down transitive dependencies + versioning which becomes brittle.  <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs">Poetry</a> solved this problem using <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml">pyproject.toml</a> configuration and lock file.

Replicating Poetry with more deterministic builds using using pyproject.toml configuration and lock file, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv">uv</a> is built in Rust by Astral as a full rethinking of Python packaging designed for speed and simplicity.  uv: pitched as "A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv and more".  <a href="https://dimasyotama.medium.com/navigating-the-python-packaging-landscape-pip-vs-poetry-vs-uv-a-developers-guide-49a9c93caf9c">Here</a> is a detailed article comparing the Python Packaging Landscape: Pip vs. Poetry vs. UV from a developer's standpoint.
