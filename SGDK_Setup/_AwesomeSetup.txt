Awesome Setup
06/06/2020

Today I look to setup SGDK development identical to devkitSMS development!!


I got basic working prototype here:
E:\Steven\XNA\SGDK\steveproXNA


01.
tmp folder
my fake setup originates here:
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\SGDKtest

this needs the following folders:
inc
res

font.h needs libres.h
but this is fake so I just copy libres.h to "inc" folder for simplicity


02.
lib folder
actually didn't need to do this
i.e. copy <genesis.h> into lib

#include <genesis.h>


03.
BUILD

AA
I wanted to suppress all the output from the make file
so instead of this
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makefile.gen

do this
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makefile.gen > NUL

BB
when code often get this warning
main.c: In function 'main':
main.c:9:3: warning: implicit declaration of function 'VDP_drawText' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   VDP_drawText( "Hello Adriana", x, y + 1 );
   ^~~~~~~~~~~~
main.c:17:3: warning: implicit declaration of function 'VDP_waitVSync' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   VDP_waitVSync();
   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is how to suppress that
But did need to add the following to suppress "implicit function declaration" generated from SGDK make build

#ifdef _CONSOLE
#include "..\tmp\genesis.h"
#else
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
#endif

IMPORTANT
last thing with this clean build setup I found that now I DON'T need to #include <genesis.h>
if fact if I do then causes problems so don't bother - the above works so go with it
