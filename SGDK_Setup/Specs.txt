Resolution
320 x 224		seems most acceptable / generic / safe values to use

IMPORTANT
google Sega Mega Drive resolution

320 x 224		NTSC
320 x 240		PAL

e.g.
From Sega Retro
Usually, resolution is denoted by width x height (in pixels). For example, a Mega Drive screenshot has a resolution of 320x224 pixels in NTSC regions, however, the resolution in PAL regions is 320Ã—240.


TODO
there are APIs in vdp.h that get width and height
I need to check these out and print out on screen
e.g.
VDP_getScreenHeight()
