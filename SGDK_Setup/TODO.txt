So I have a workable solution on this laptop although Remote Debugging doesn't seem to work...


Here are some outstanding things to complete in order to document:


Finalize version of SGDK to work with to do examples:

Download source code for gens.exe to run locally

Put gens.exe into C:\SEGA in order to debug via Eclipse

Setup Eclipse - what version and standardize install process

Document how to import VS2015 SGDK project in Eclipse + debug step thru C code via Eclipse

Ideally have 3x ways to run MD code projects


VS2015 makefile project
VS2015 console project and mock SGDK similar to devKitSMS mocking so can F5 debug step thru code
Eclipse programming setup and remote debugging


NB: another option is CodeBlocks BUT won't be able to debug step thru code
plus don't know how to you can build source code then build.bat to launch software in emulator


VS2015
could you create solution the add 3x projects
1. console mode app
2. make file
3. static library where all the code lives?
