IMPORTANT
I have lots of pre-reqs from SMS development that are probably used:
e.g.
cygwin
git bash
JAVA




SGDK 1.51 (april 2020)
https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/releases
https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/releases/download/v1.51/sgdk151.7z


UPDATE
Actually prefer to git clone from master as the latest commits (Jun-2020) resolves this warning:

https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/issues/133



Download SGDK zip and extract to
C:\SGDK

Move all files there


Add 2x environment variables
%GDK%		C:/SGDK
%GDK_WIN%	C:\SGDK


Start | run | cmd
cd %GDK_WIN%
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makelib.gen


IMPORTANT
older version of SGDK	<= 1.41
PLAN_A
PLAN_B
VDP_setTextPlan
VDP_clearPlan


newer version of SGDK
BG_A
BG_B
VDP_setTextPlane
VDP_clearPlane


also IMPORTANT
if you have an old version of SGDK but upgrade to new version
and coding and you get old API listed in VS2015 intellisense
then do the following

Close VS2015
Delete .vs folder
re-open VS2015
now old API should NOT appear in the intellisense list
