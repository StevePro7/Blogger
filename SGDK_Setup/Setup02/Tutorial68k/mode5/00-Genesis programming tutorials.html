<h1>Genesis programming tutorials!</h1>
<p>How-to's for programming the SEGA Genesis. Everything will be done in 68K assembly, and code samples will be provided. Send me an e-mail via ComradeOj@yahoo.com if you have questions. Tutorials will build off of each other, so you might want to start with the first one.</p>

<p>Think the "hello world" program is the simplest thing? WRONG! There are tons of things that must be learned before you even draw a single character of text onto the screen.</p>

<h3>Lessson 2 - Conditional operations.</h3>
<p>Like lesson 1, but with conditional statements.</p>
