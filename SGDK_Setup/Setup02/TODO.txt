E:\GitHub\StevePro7\SGDK_Ideas\SGDK_MultiFolders\04-HelloResources
E:\GitHub\StevePro7\SGDK_Ideas\SGDK_Demos\04-HelloFolders


Clone "Hello Resources"
Update resources as necc.
i.e. replace old resources with new resources
ensure there is resources and resources.res file updated
build.bat to build new resources
Update gfx / resources.c with new resources

Launch VS2015 | open Game.sln
Add new filters / folders and code
Update project properties
Build + debug step F5

Finally, copy makefile.gen from %GDK_WIN% do dev folder
Amend to include new folders e.g. engine + screen

Update out folder e.g. "src" and manually create new folders
e.g. engine + screen
Update build.bat

old
::%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makefile.gen > NUL

new
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f makefile.gen > NULL


For completeness strip out any unnecessary steps in the makefile  especially if you are not building *.s files!

Library
don't forget to mention that I "merged" libres.h fron GDK_WIN\res folder into my "lib" folder
that way do not need to have an additional #include


Also with the original libres.h when I SGDK build against it
ensure you do not get that weird error about the "foreign" characters
e.g.
was an older version of the SGDK so if you get the latest then shouldn't be an issue

reference

e.g.
_E_\SGDK\VSTUDIO\_.._RES_LIBRES_H_


Also warnings with sprintf
soln upgrade to latest version 1.51 not sort but need to get master

mention here about configure gens keys
if it doesn't work i.e. crash then may be build gens from source
and copy the the new cfg files across to
