Library
don't forget to mention that I "merged" libres.h fron GDK_WIN\res folder into my "lib" folder
that way do not need to have an additional #include


Also with the original libres.h when I SGDK build against it
ensure you do not get that weird error about the "foreign" characters
e.g.
was an older version of the SGDK so if you get the latest then shouldn't be an issue

Also warnings with sprintf
soln upgrade to latest version 1.51 not sort but need to get master
