SETUP
VS2015 + make project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx8__lr4Ao4

VS2015
File | New project | Visual C++ | General | Makefile Project
Name		Game
Location	E:\Steven\XNA\SGDK\Stephane-D\Tut00
create directory	UNCHECKED

Build command line
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makefile.gen


Copy build.bat from other projects


IMPORTANT
if you build the project using build.bat from the command line then will produce out\rom.bin
OK which you can launch in emulator

However, in order to build from Ctrl+Shift+B using make build command in VS2015 you MUST add
include directories so <genesis.h> will be detected correctly

e.g.
right click project
Properties
VC++ Directories
Include Directories
$(GDK_WIN)\inc;$(ProjectDir)res;$(IncludePath)


NB: I think it is always a good idea to remove the additional x64 build configuration
esp as MD is 16-bit only


Update build.bat
work out how to access fully qualified path to out\rom.bin
via variable	%~dp0
