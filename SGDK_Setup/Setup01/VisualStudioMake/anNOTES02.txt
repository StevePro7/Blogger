Develop Games using the Sega Genesis SDK and Visual Studio - Setup

VS2015

change tact!

setup via YouTube video

Ctrl + Shift + B to build ROM
manually open rom.bin in emulator

Can partial automate this process
by double click build.bat or run build.bat fron cmd prompt
each time after rebuild code to auto launch newly built ROM into emulator


OR
can wire up Ctrl+1 from devkit Sample II as hot key to auto launch
newly built ROM into emulator


SUMMARY
another option is to build code changes in VS2015 and auto launch in one process:
Automate this process by setting up
Remote Debugger

E:\Steven\XNA\SGDK\_codeTests\SDGK_test03_VSremote


TODO

//Can make changes and rebuild + launch

This speeds things up but ultimately we'd like to replicate our build environment
like devkitSMS

so we can build source code in ASNI-C and F5 to debug step thru the ANSI-C code
which just stubs out any calls to any Sega dev kit code [treat like black box]

but also be able to build + auto launch code built from build bat script in one action
e.g.
Ctrl+1

sim to what we achieved in devkitSMS prog'ging

this will be the topic of the next post
