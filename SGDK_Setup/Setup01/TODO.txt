SUMMARY
Of the 4x setups VS2015 is the most applicable as we are used to this from previous SMS dev

However, while we use existing setup can build the source and could even add build.bat script
and wire up Ctrl+1 to auto build + run to IDE from VS2015

we are not currently able to debug step thru the source code using this VS2015 setup as make file project

However, we able to setup build, debug and run all from within VS2015 for SMS development
therefore, we would like to replicate the same for productive SGDK development

this will be the topic of the next post
