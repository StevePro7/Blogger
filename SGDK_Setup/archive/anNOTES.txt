Today I made a start at setting up the SGDK on the laptop


https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK

git clone https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK.git


I actually copied what I had from home PC to
C:\SGDK


I bet this was the download from tag v1.34

as outlined on 
Retro Mike
Develop Games using the Sega Genesis SDK and Visual Studio - Setup

Launch VS2015

got this working
copied old code from home PC
C:\Steven\Personal\INSTALLATIONSEGA\SGDK\_codeTests\SDGK_test

open SLN file

Ctrl + Shift + B
build

Ctrl + 1
launch in Fusion via build.bat


IMPORTANT
Must have reference to include file
C:\SGDK\inc;$(IncludePath)


right click project
Properties
VC=+ Directories


IMPORTANT
in order to F5 or Ctrl+F5 MUST have Remote Debugging set
this ideally build + run out to emulator in one step

instead of build then launch build.bat to run



SUMMARY
I git clone SGDK
dumped contents directly into
C:\SGDK

I setup the 2x env vars [above]
I open existing Make file projects in VS2015

I build Ctrl + Shift + B
I run 	Ctrl + 1



Today I had success running the following programs
