warnings
07/06/2020


For some strange reason sometimes build code w/o warnings but every now and then get those 2x pesky warnings:

warning: extra tokens at end of #ifndef directove
warning: ISO C99 requires whitespace after the macro name


Therefore, I simply modified to get rid of the "\" and ".."
i.e.
change this from this to this

BEFORE
_E_\SGDK\VSTUDIO\_.._RES_LIBRES_H_

AFTER
_E_SGDK_VSTUDIO_RES_LIBRES_H_


and the warnings now seem to "disappear"
