TODO blurb about scrolling why so popular in 8-bit video games

side scrolling action games, Shoot 'em ups, Beat 'em ups,

banked code
TODO - don't forget to write about the algorithm for the linked code BANK address  

https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS

use the provided crt0_sms.rel as the first module in your linker call
instruct the linker to place all the banked code at address 0x4000 + the virtual address of the bank, which is banknumber×2¹⁶ (so code segment BANK1 goes at 0x14000, code segment BANK2 goes at 0x24000 and so on...) and the compiled banked code modules in ascending order as in:

  sdcc -o your_program.ihx -mz80 --no-std-crt0 --data-loc 0xC000 -Wl-b_BANK1=0x14000 -Wl-b_BANK2=0x24000 crt0_sms.rel SMSlib.lib main.rel banked_code_1.rel banked_code_2.rel
