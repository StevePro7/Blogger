e.g.
set -x : Display commands and their arguments as they are executed.
set -v : Display shell input lines as they are read.


Corroborate this
e.g.
set --help

-v  Print shell input lines as they are read.
-x  Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.


Shell scripts here use
set -e
-e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
