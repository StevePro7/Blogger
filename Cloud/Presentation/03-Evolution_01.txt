Evolution of S/W Deployment: Physical Servers to Container Orchestration
<br /><br />

1. Era of Physical Servers: 1990s and Before
<br />
Back in the 1990s Software was predominantly deployed directly onto physical servers, often housed in on-premises data centers.  Each server typically dedicated to specific application [or set of applications].
