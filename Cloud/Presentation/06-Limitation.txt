LIMITATION - localhost
<br />
Hello World fine for localhost but has limitations
<br /><br />

1. Limitations:
<br />
<table width="99%" border="1">
<tr>
<td>
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
Everything is on localhost - Cloud Computing typically requires Kubernetes cluster(s)
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
Manually build Docker image from the Dockerfile
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
Manually push Docker image to container registry
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
Manually deploy running Docker container into Kubernetes cluster [typically Deployment exposed as Service]
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
All Kubernetes resource values are hardcoded into declarative YAML file [again Deployment exposed as Service]
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
No facility to scale deployment across multiple environments: DEV, UAT, Prod
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
Environment variables can be injected but is a brittle and cumbersome process
<br />
&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Wingdings';">•</span>&nbsp;
No real immediate and secure way to inject secret information into deployment [e.g. Database password]
<br />

2. Solution:
<br />
Integrate GitLab CI/CD pipeline to solve these issues and automate build and deployment process!
