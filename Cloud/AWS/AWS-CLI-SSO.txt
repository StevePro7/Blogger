Enable console access
Pwd4


aws s3 ls --profile AdministratorAccess-476230071208

IMPORTANT
Q. what is my AWS ACCOUNT ID?
A. echo `aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text`


SUMMARY
in the end I just disabled MFA on AWS SSO
as the MFA codes would never sync!! ??

Here is what I did:
log on to AWS console

root
steven_boland@hotmail.com
pwd


Search for SSO
IAM Identity Center

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=eu-west-1#/instances/68040f5f581e1411/organization/accounts
https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/organization/home?region=eu-west-1#/instances/68040f5f581e1411/accounts

I added user	SteveProXNA
I added group	SteveProGroup
I added permission set		AdministratorAccess

then you need to update the ~/.aws/config file
add the following

sso_start_url = <AWS access portal URL>
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_account_id = <account_id>
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = eu-west-1
output = json


sso_start_url = <AWS access portal URL>
IAM Identity Center | Settings | Identity source
AWS access portal URL


sso_account_id = <account_id>
e.g.
4xxxxxxxxxxx


Linux terminal
aws sso login


IMPORTANT
the first time I added User SteveProXNA
I had to verify the user

I uses the Google Authenticator app to do this
scan QR code
enter 6x digits when prompted for the MFA
