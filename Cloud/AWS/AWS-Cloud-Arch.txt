Basics of AWS Cloud Architecture

01. AWS Cloud Provider: The Foundation
Canvas to build digital cloud-based svcs + apps
ex: Single-Tier architecture


02. Region: Defining Geographical Scope
Region = geographical area w/ multiple data centers
like city to build digital infrastructure


03. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Creating a Digital Fortress
VPC = Virtual Private Cloud
isolate resources to communicate securely
like digital fortress create boundary for apps + data


04. Availability Zone: Building Redundancy
AZ = Availability Zone
separate data centers
distribute resources across AZs = enhance redundancy + high availability
like backup generators for digital city


05. Public Subnet: Facing the World
Subnet = neighbourhoods for VPC
Public subnet = resources directly accessible from Internet


06. EC2 Instance: The Digital Workhorse
EC2 = Elastic Cloud Compute = virtual server in the cloud
EC2 = computer running in data center = workhorse for apps


07. Route 53: Navigating the Digital Streets
Route 53 = DNS [Domain Name System] service
like street signs on the Internet
translates domain names into IP addresses computers understand
directs traffic efficiently to resources


08. Internet Gateway: Connecting to the Outside World
Internet Gateway = gateway to digital city
allows communication btwn VPC and the Internet
resources in public subnets use the Internet Gateway to be access to/from Internet


09. Load Balancer: Balancing the Digital Load
Load Balancer = distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances
like traffic cop ensures no single instance bears too much load
improves fault tolerance and scalability


10. Routing Table: Directing Traffic Within the VPC
Routing Table = digital GPS directing traffic in VPC
specifies where traffic should go e.g. to Internet, another subnet or an internal resource
like street plan for digital city


OTHERS
Security Groups and Network ACLs
digital bouncers controlling inbout / outbound traffic to EC2 instances + [public/private] subnets

Elastic IP
static IP for EC2 instances ensure keep same IP address after stop / start

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
scalable object storage service like digital garage for storing / retrieving and amount of data

Elastic Block Store (EBS)
block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances like digital closet
