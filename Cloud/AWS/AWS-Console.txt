Instances
virutal computing environments

AMI
Amazon Machine Images
bits for server incl. OS

Instance Types
CPU, memory, storage + networking capacity
e.g.
t2.micro

Key Pairs
instances login info

Instance store volumes
storage for temp data

EBS
Elastic Block Store	volumes

Firewall
protocols, ports, source IP addr for security groups

Elastic IP address 

VPC
Virtual Private Cloud
virtual networks logically isolated from rest of AWS clouse

Set up to use Amazon EC2
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html

Create key pair

Connect to your Linux instance using SSH
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html

ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem my-instance-user-name@my-instance-public-dns-name
e.g.
cd ~/Downloads

command listed there to copy + paste into Terminal

cd to where *.pem public / private key pair live
cd ~/Downloads

Instances and AMIs

Instance Types
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html

Tags
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html


Retrieve the public key from the private key
ssh-keygen -y -f my-public-private-key.pem


Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html

A security group actus as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances
to control incoming and outgoing traffic

When you launch an instance in a VPC you must specify a security group
that's created for that VPC


Elastic IP addresses
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html

an elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing


Virtual private clouds
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html

VPC enables you to define a virtual network in your own logically isolated area with the AWS cloud
known as a virtual private cloud.  You launch instances into your default VPC


Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html

EBS provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances
EBS volumes behave like raw unformatted block devices
mount these volumes as devices on your instances

EBS volumes are attached to an instance and exposed as storage volumes that persist
independently from the life of the instance

Create a file system on top of these volumes or use them in any way you would use
a block device e.g. hard disk drive

EBS volumes are well suited for primary storage for file systems, databases or any
applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw unformatted block level storage


Amazon EC2 instance store
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html

instance store is ideal for temporary storage of info that changes frequently



Tutorial: Install a LAMP web server on Amazon Linux 2
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-lamp-amazon-linux-2.html

we connect to the instance created above via ssh
ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem my-instance-user-name@my-instance-public-dns-name

sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2


sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt install php

cat /etc/system-release

What is Amazon VPC?
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html

VPC is the networking layer for EC2

VPC
virtual network

Subnet
range of IP addresses for VPC

Route table
set of rules [routes] used to determine where network traffic is directed

Internet gateway
gateway you attach to VPC to enable communication btwn resources in VPC and the internet

VPC endpoint
enable private connect VPC to AWS services w/o requiring internet gateway,
NAT device, VPN connection or AWS direct connect
NB:
instances in VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate w/ resources in the service
traffic btwn VPC and other service does not leave the Amazon network

CIDR block
Classless InterDomain Routing
an internet protocol address allocation and route aggregation methodology
