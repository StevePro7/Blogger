IMPORTANT

following all the instructions I was able to provision an AWS-kubeadm cluster
NB: I did need to copy the admin.conf file to the standard location
/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
/home/$USER/.kube/config

But I got permission denied - the reason was because KUBECONFIG was pointing to source
need to update this to point to the destination i.e
export KUBECONFIG=/home/$USER/.kube/config
