Git integration
16/08/2019

While I was messing around with this tutorial I managed to add to Git on Azure

Still not sure how I did this because the initial push con't to prompt me with username and password

https://dev.azure.com/SteveProStudios/_git/XUnitTest/commits?itemPath=%2F&itemVersion=GBmaster


Username	SteveProStudios
Email		steven_boland@hotmail.com
Pwd		SP5


I did link all my Azure DevOps to Git using the StevePro7 account
[as this all for testing]

I did add the following to global .gitconfig but not sure if this helped or not

[credential]

	helper = manager

	useHttpPath = true

i.e. from this 
https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows-Popups/qaq-p/579905

git config --global credential.helper manager
git config --global credential.useHttpPath true



Somehow magically there was an access token created that linked STEVEPRO-PC

IMPORTANT
I *think* I may know what happened to magically make this work
The initial commits were under the default global Git account "StevePro7"
but I went on the command line and changed the user.name and user.email for this repo
I could commit + push from VS2019 but I think after the user.name change it now worked from CLI

git config --get user.name
git config user.name "SteveProStudios"

git config --get user.email
git config user.email "steven_boland@hotmail.com"
