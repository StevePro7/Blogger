<u>Summary</u><br />
To summarize, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kubernetes-vs-docker">Docker</a> provides an open standard for packaging and distributing containerized applications, however, the challenge can then become how to coordinate and schedule increasing amount of containers?
<br /><br />
This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> can help: Kubernetes is open-source orchestration software that provides an API controlling how and where those containers will run.  Kubernetes can scale out multple deployed and more!
<br />
This will be the topic of the next post.
