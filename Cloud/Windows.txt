Launch VS 2022
Open eShopOnContainers SLN
Clean + Rebuild
complains about Docker Desktop not installed

Says that WSL is pre-req?
wsl.exe --install
C:\Windows\System32

Reboot
Start | run | cmd | wsl
Wsl/WSL_E_WSL_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_REQUIRED

Pretty sure I had to check

TODO - get the image off Windows laptop
Reboot
Start | run | cmd | wsl

Start | MS Store

Reboot
Start | run | cmd | wsl
