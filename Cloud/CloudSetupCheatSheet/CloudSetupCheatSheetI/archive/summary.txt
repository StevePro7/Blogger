To summarize, we have setup CLIs for Azure, Amazon and Google and provisioned an 
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks">Azure AKS</a>
Kubernetes cluster with end-to-end testing.  

Next, we will resume to provision clusters for 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html">Amazon EKS</a>
and 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview">Google GKE</a>
.  

This will be the topic of the next post.
