ASP.NET Core
much better container optimization
image is much smaller than .NET Framework
cross platform = deploy server apps to Linux Docker containers


ASP.NET Core
host on IIS, Nginx, Apache, Docker or self-host


MVC
Model		data
View		UI
Controller	orchestrate workflow


Model binding
automatically maps data from HTTP requests to action method parameters

Model validation
performs client-side and server-side validation



Containers — Docker: Introduction


Container
idea of running multiple applications on single host

similar to compute virtualization but instead of virtualizing server to create multiple operating systems
containers offer more lightweight alternative by virtualizing operating system allowing multiple workloads on single host


Docker
open source project to automate deployment o fapplications as portable self sufficient containers that run in the cloud [or on premises]
https://github.com/moby/moby

Docker
more efficient at sharing OS kernel and libraries thus more lightweight than Virtual Machines [VMs]


VMs
provide full process isolation for applications [as have full OS + full library per VM] but isolation comes at great cost
[heavy, inefficient, expensive]


Why docker?
containers allow developer to package application with all dependent libraries and ship as one package


EXAMPLE
Windows download + install Docker
Windows will prompt to enable Hyper-V and Containers windows features
restart


dotnet new mvc
dotnet run
localhost:5000
localhost:5001


Dockerfile
FROM microsoft/dotnet:sdk AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy everything else and build
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Build runtime image
FROM microsoft/dotnet:aspnetcore-runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "HelloWorld.dll"]


Docker can build images automatically by reading instructions from Dockerfile

Dockerfile
textfile that contains all commands user could call on the command line to assemble an image


FROM
sets the baseImage
must be first instruction in Dockerfile


WORKDIR
sets working directory for any subsequent ADD, COPY, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, or RUN instructions
default dir is /app
creates dir if not exist


COPY
copy files + folders from source to desh path in image filesystem


RUN
execute any commands on top of current image


ENTRYPOINT
configures container to be run as an executable
set it to use the web app



All instructions in Dockerfile
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder
ADD
COPY
ENV
EXPOSE
FROM
LABEL
STOPSIGNAL
USER
VOLUME
WORKDIR
ONBUILD (when combined with one of the supported instructions above)


docker build -t helloworld .
docker images


docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name HelloWorld helloworld
docker ps

browser
http://localhost:8080


We can see the MVC web app dockerized running locally in port 8080!
