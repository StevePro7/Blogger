Distills Docker to three things:

1. control groups
2. namespaces
3. chroot



1. control groups	[cgroups]
limits the amount of resources you want someone to be able to control in your container
allows resources to be shared and managed

Docker
arch linux
manage resource here
/etc/security/limits.conf

control how much RAM, storage, access to gpus etc.

know where cgroup files are
see how docker creates them


2. namespaces
if cgroups control what you can use then namespaces are what you can see

namespaces
control access to processes, mounts, networking and other things you see

mainly focus on processes + networking 
'cos processes on container are different from processes on your machine

you are only in control of processes on that container


3. chroot
creating docker container you specify image so

Chroot allows you to change the apparent root directory
so we have
file system
control how much memory, storage, gpus and other hardware options using cgroups

control processes, mounts and networking using namespaces

change apparent root to be any linux filesystem be it ubuntu, opensue, redhat etc using chroot


To summary
docker abstracts linux cgroups, namespaces, chroot from us via containers


chroot /path/to/file/you/want/to/be/the/apparent/root
