weird but today when I went to do for Envoy dynamic config
docker-compose

it was weird because was version 1.25.x
so I followed steps to remove from here using sudo apt remove docker-compose
/usr/bin/docker-compose

But when restart PC it now worked from here
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose

just had to do
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
