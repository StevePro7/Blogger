Platform Engineering
The process of creating and maintaining a set of proprietary internal tools
that help speed up software development

While the process is something thought as the next phase of DevOps,
it is better to think of it as DevOps' supporting backbone


Internal Developer Platform	IDP
Toolset that platform engineering works to create

Input	platform engineering
Output	internal developer platform

Tools
meant to hasten the development of applications, remove bottlenecks,
and improve the onboarding process for new hires

IDP
scalable growing alongside a company's operational needs
automate repetitive and tedious tasks and simplify workflows

e.g.
Cloud development = key example of IDP
enable developer self-service for provisioning cloud-native applications


TEAM
Software infrastructure like Kubernetes and IAM roles

Empathy
understand how platform problems affect the end user

Perspective
envision how IDP will evolve over time as IDP development = iterative process

Partnership
collaborate: 
anticipate how code will be interpreted
write code that is easily understood
