Development teams <a href="https://content.techgig.com/technology/5-components-to-learn-googles-golang-coding-language/articleshow/76976910.cms">prefer</a> Golang to harness the power of large servers and sophisticated cloud platorms.  Go can be used in mobile, web and simple game development and can also invoke C code directly via <a href="https://go.dev/blog/cgo">Cgo</a>.


Golang Cheat Sheet

Golang is a statically typed and compiled programming language designed at Google. Go plays a major role in Enterprises by developing highly scalable concurrent cloud computing systems like Docker + Kubernetes.

Summary
To summarize, we have a simple setup for Golang programming on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux. There is much to explore e.g. Cloud Computing and developing highly scalable concurrent applications using Golang!
This will be topic of the next post


Retrospective XIII

Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of infrastructure [hardware / servers], storage + databases via the Internet frequently delivered by cloud-based platforms: Amazon AWS / Google GCP / Microsoft Azure.

Cloud Native is architecture for assembling these cloud-based components optimized for cloud environment; Not about servers but the services. Enterprises modernize their infrastructure and process by choosing cloud technologies e.g. Docker for containerization, Kuberenetes for orchestration, that best fit their specific needs

CGo
CGo is a technology which allows Go programs to interoperate with C libraries. For example distributed cloud computing packages 

Another example eBPF: a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed C programs safely and efficiently extending the capabilities of the Linux kernel, without requiring changes to kernel source code or load kernel modules, consumed from Go packages providing high-performance networking in cloud native environments.

Summary
Writing low level C code to target 8-bit Sega Master System hardware and now the 16-bit Sega Mega Drive it has proved to be very valuable experience for CGo applications which could assist in Go + Cloud Computing. The next challenge is port projects exclusively on Windows and include Linux system builds cross platform
