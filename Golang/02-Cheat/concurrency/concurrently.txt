Rob Pike
concurrency is the computations of independently executing computations



Goroutines
special type of function that can run while other goroutines are running


channel
the arrow points to where the value is going
writing to a channel, the arrow points the value to the channel
reading from a channel, the arrow points the channel to the variable

Notice that the arrow is pointing out of the channel for reading
and pointing into the channel for writing


NB:
too many goroutines
resource starvation
