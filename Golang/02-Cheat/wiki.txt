<br /><br />
  
<u>Packages</u><br>
Go programs are built by linking together <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Packages">packages</a>.  A package is constructed from one or more source files that declare constants, types, variables and functions belonging to the package to which are accessible in all files of the sams package.  Those elements may be exported and used in other package(s).

Development teams <a href="https://content.techgig.com/technology/5-components-to-learn-googles-golang-coding-language/articleshow/76976910.cms">prefer</a> Golang to harness the power of large servers and sophisticated cloud platorms.  Go can be used in mobile, web and simple game development and can also invoke C code directly via <a href="https://go.dev/blog/cgo">Cgo</a>.
