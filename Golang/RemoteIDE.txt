External file changes 


NB: I checked the Settings
and changed the default heap size from
2048 to 8192


IMPORTANT
the screen doesn't seem to auto refresh the files on the server
but maybe that's OK as the File Watcher is disabled and could impact performance??

no problems tho' you can simply click away into another file
and click back into the source file and the changes are re-loaded on-the-fly
