https://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2021/08/docker-cheat-sheet.html

Download Docker Desktop
Go to the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Click Download for Mac (Apple chip)
Click the Apple menu > About This Mac > Look under “Processor” or “Chip”.

docker --version
docker run hello-world


Optional: Install via Homebrew (CLI only)
brew install --cask docker
open /Applications/Docker.app
Docker still needs the Desktop app to run containers on macOS.
