github ssh key setup instructions for mac - surely I should I use authentication key type



Yes — when you set up SSH for GitHub on a Mac, you should pick a modern authentication key type, not just use the default blindly.

GitHub now recommends Ed25519 for most users, because it’s more secure and shorter than RSA, unless you have compatibility constraints (e.g., very old systems).

Here’s the step-by-step for macOS, with Ed25519 as the key type:

1. Check for existing SSH keys
bash
Copy
Edit
ls -al ~/.ssh
Look for files named:

id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub

or id_rsa and id_rsa.pub

If you already have a usable key, you can reuse it, but for GitHub, it’s often best to make a fresh one.

2. Generate a new Ed25519 SSH key
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
-t ed25519 → key type

-C → comment (usually your GitHub email)

When prompted:

Press Enter to save to the default location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519).

Optionally enter a passphrase for extra security.

3. Start the SSH agent
bash
Copy
Edit
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
4. Add your SSH key to the agent
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
(--apple-use-keychain ensures macOS remembers it after reboot.)

5. Copy your public key
bash
Copy
Edit
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Now it’s in your clipboard.

6. Add it to GitHub
Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

Paste your key into the Key field.

Give it a title (e.g., “MacBook Pro”).

Save.

7. Test your connection
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see something like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
✅ Key type recommendation:

Use ed25519 unless you know you need RSA for compatibility.

If you must use RSA (e.g., old corporate systems), choose:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
If you want, I can give you the exact commands for replacing your old RSA key with Ed25519 without breaking your current GitHub access. That’s a slightly trickier dance. Would you like me to lay that out?
