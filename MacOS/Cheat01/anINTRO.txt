INTRO
Linux for modern cloud computing
However many corporations still like to use
Enterprise SW apps e.g. Microsoft Office 365

Therefore, it seems that despite the fact that 
Linux supports Docker / K8s natively, corporates
prefer to use UNIX based OS w/ Enterprise SW

Thus the MAC growing in popularity
The issue is that if you are a long-time 
Windows or Linux user the keyboard shortcuts are significantly different

tl;dr
if you are "forced" to use a Mac at work
it would be awesome to be able to seamless transfer all memory muscle / keyboard shortcuts directly to the Mac
