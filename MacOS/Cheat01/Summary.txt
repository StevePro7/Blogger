We setup MacOS S/W and configured stuff
We mod'd keyboard to have best like for like Win/Lin in general terms [Ctrl]
but lots of applications don't respect Modifier Keys
After some research an alternative could be to revert back to Apple Mod key default
but configure custom key config across all apps like F2=Rename and/or customize
key config per application

PIC
however this could be ridiculuously time consuming and still not guarantee 100%
like for like
Instead for now keep [ctrl => cmd] for general and for specific apps override
keyboard shortcuts where possible - this will be topic of next post
