kubectl setup autocomplete	ISSUE
TODO

have to re-install bash

Q. am I going to complete?


01.
kubectl Quick Reference
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference

IMPORTANT
complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k

default but there is an issue on Tab = auto complete on Mac
get pesky error TODO - get error - __start_kubectl

I was checking out error to update bash and replace
complete -F __start_kubectl k



WHEN I attempt to upgrade BASH to cope with error I locked out Terminal
Here is the fix

Shell locked out
context: tried to change shell due to the k8s autocomplete not working out-of-the-box

When I start my terminal I get "login: /usr/local/bin/bash: No such file or directory [Process completed]" and i cant type anything in my terminal

1. Go to "System Preferences" > "Users & Groups"
2. Click the "Lock" icon and authenticate
3. Right-click the your user icon and select "Advanced Options"
4. Change the value for "Login shell" to /bin/bash
