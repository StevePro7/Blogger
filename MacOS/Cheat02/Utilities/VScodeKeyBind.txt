VS Code


01. NAV


Code

Type to search in keybindings
cursorTop
click pencil icon
Change KeyBinding

Press desired key combination and then press Enter


3x existing keys have this binding
click link
on each entry 
right click 
Remove Keybinding


Command			Keybinding	When		Desc
cursorTop		Ctrl + Home	textInputFocus	Move to beg of file	

NB: When is textInputFocus for all


01b.
You may like to customise stuff e.g. 
Ctrl + Shift + T
New Terminal window

Code
Settings
Keyboard Shortcuts

Terminal: Create New Terminal	Ctrl + Shift + T
NB: again remove any previous keybindings to avoid conflict



02. Terminal
pwd
/Users/stevepro/Library/Application Support/Code/User

cd
cd Library/Application\ Support/Code/User
cat keybindings.json


IMPORTANT
remember that I had a partial entry for cmd+right and that prevented it from working!!

No need for Ctrl + Shift + left / right on the terminal!
