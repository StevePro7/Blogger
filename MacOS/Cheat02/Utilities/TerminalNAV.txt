Mac OS X Terminal: Map option+delete to "backward delete word"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/327664/mac-os-x-terminal-map-optiondelete-to-backward-delete-word

Terminal
Settings...
Profiles
Keyboard tab
Use Option as Meta key		CHECKED

However, when you change modifier keys
i.e. swap Ctrl + Cmd then this won't work anymore!

IMPORTNAT
also found difficulty in re-defining keys e.g.
Ctrl + left / right

Therefore for "intense" work in the Terminal may have to opt to use built-in terminal from other app
e.g.
VS Code or PyCharm
