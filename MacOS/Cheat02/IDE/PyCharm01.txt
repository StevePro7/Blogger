Plugins
Keymap
VS Code (Mac)


Settings | Plugins | VS Code Keymap (Mac)
Settings | Keymap | VS Code Keymap

NOTE
If Ctrl + Shift + O launches Symbols then remove duplicate: Choose Settings | Keymap | filter as "symbol". Double click Navigate | Go to Symbol | Edit | Remove Ctrl+Shift+O | Apply | OK. Repeat this as necessary.


PyCharm
Ctrl|Shift+O
symbols "bug"
remember to remove via Poland blog post
e.g.
Settings Keymap  filter "symbol"
Goto symbol
remove ctrl+chift+O
OK




Settings | Keymap | Main menu | Navigate | Back
Alt + Left

BUT this would now conflct with Ctrl+Left
because Alt = Ctrl now due to modifier keys

TODO in PyCharm
Alt+Left arrow			Navigate back
in the end chose to do Alt + Up	Navigate back
		and down 	Navigate forward
as a compromise

99.
PyCharm
earlier today I did 
Alt + Up		Navigate back
Alt + Down		Navigate forward

because Alt + Left / Right is used for move word prev / next
due to double up with Command



PyCharm
extend Ctrl+F5 to run
already does this but we swap Control for Command
so just add the new keycap
Settings Keycap filter "Run"
Run/Debug
Add keyboard shortcut
