NOTE
If Ctrl + Shift + O launches Symbols then remove duplicate: Choose Settings | Keymap | filter as "symbol". Double click Navigate | Go to Symbol | Edit | Remove Ctrl+Shift+O | Apply | OK. Repeat this as necessary.


PyCharm
Ctrl|Shift+O
symbols "bug"
remember to remove via Poland blog post
e.g.
Settings Keymap  filter "symbol"
Goto symbol
remove ctrl+chift+O
OK




Settings | Keymap | Main menu | Navigate | Back
Alt + Left

BUT this would now conflct with Ctrl+Left
because Alt = Ctrl now due to modifier keys



PyCharm
extend Ctrl+F5 to run
already does this but we swap Control for Command
so just add the new keycap
Settings Keycap filter "Run"
Run/Debug
Add keyboard shortcut
