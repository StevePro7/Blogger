QUOTE
These commands worked by sending a particular character sequence to the terminal, which was a best effort guess based on what command keybindings terminals use. The problem with these commands was that they were a black box, you needed to literally search through the vscode codebase to figure out how they worked. They have been replaced with custom keybindings for the workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence command, which does the same thing in a generic way.
