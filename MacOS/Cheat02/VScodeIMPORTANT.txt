VS Code

IMPORTANT
while I was setting up VS Code keyboard bindings
I realised the information on  the blog was bare


Try this
Launch VS Code | Settings | Keyboard Shortcuts

Search for Command
cursorTop
Click pen icon on LHS
Press desired keybinding
e.g.
Ctrl + Home

If VS Code prompts you that binding already present then
remove all existing key binding(s)

Repeat
Ctrl + Home
Enter

repeat until all the keys listed have been updated !!
