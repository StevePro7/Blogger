VS Code
09-Aug-2025


IMPORTANT
01.
while I was setting up VS Code keyboard bindings
I realised the information on  the blog was bare


Try this
Launch VS Code | Settings | Keyboard Shortcuts

Search for Command
cursorTop
Click pen icon on LHS
Press desired keybinding
e.g.
Ctrl + Home

If VS Code prompts you that binding already present then
remove all existing key binding(s)

Repeat
Ctrl + Home
Enter

repeat until all the keys listed have been updated !!


02.
The final section there was an issue updating the new laptop
on
Ctrl + Right
did not work

Why?
this clause was missing

 	 "when":	 "terminalFocus"


SOLUTION
simply add the "when" clause and now works OK !!


 {	 	 
 	 "key":	 "cmd+right",
 	 "command":	 "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
 	 "args":	 { "text": "\u001bf" },
 	 "when":	 "terminalFocus"
 },
