After installing Postgres server one can use pgAdmin client for data access.  However, it seems challenging to customize navigation here.  An excellent alternative is Database Tools + SQL plugin available from PyCharm.  This plugin is available only in PyCharm Professional but may prove to be a valuable investment longterm <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span>
