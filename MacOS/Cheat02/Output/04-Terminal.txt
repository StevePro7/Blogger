<u>Terminal</u><br />
Ideally we would like to update navigation on Terminal due to frequent use: Terminal | Settings... | Profiles.  Keyboard tab customize Key and Action settings.  Check <i>Use Option as Meta Key</i> to "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/327664/mac-os-x-terminal-map-optiondelete-to-backward-delete-word">backward delete word</a>".  Unfortunately, Terminal navigation not aligned therefore will prefer IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm terminals.
