<u>Terminal</u><br />
Ideally we would like to update navigation on Terminal due to frequent use: Terminal | Settings... | Profiles.  Keyboard tab customize Key and Action settings.  Check <i>Use Option as Meta Key</i> to "backward delete word".  Unfortunately, not aligned Terminal navigation therefore will prefer IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm terminals.
