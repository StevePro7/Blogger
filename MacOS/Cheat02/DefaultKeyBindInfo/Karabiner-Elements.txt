Finally, in researching Default Key Bindings many posts promote <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">Karabiner-Elements</a> as a powerful keyboard customizer for macOS.  However, it has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/mxq20w/option_leftright_arrows_remapped_to">recommended</a> not to use on M1 hardware due to kernel panics.

IMPORTANT
Don't install Karabiner Elements => kernel panic on M1
maybe I need to "disable Mission Control" Ctrl+left / right

Second, I wouldn't recommend using KeyRemap4MacBook (now known as Karabiner Elements) to do this as mentioned in one of the answers on that StackExchange page you mentioned as it installs a system extension that currently is causing kernel panics on M1 hardware.
