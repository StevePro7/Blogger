Intro
Google + Apple regularly force updates
e.g.
Android API 28
iPhone6 screen res
plus of course mobile apps + games MUST be 64-bit compliant...!

Hence another reason to upgrade to lates MG 3.7
as older versions won't work with 64-bit sound drivers for 3.4

let's check it out

GENERAL
Install Visual Studio 2017	Xamarin screen shot
Install MonoGame 3.7

MonoGame pipeline builder
claim that org games like CandyKid which used older version of MonoGame [3.4 + 3.5]

ANDROID
PreReqs
Install Android Studio
Setup Android SDK
this is C:\Program Files
but Android Studio may be different location so consolidate

Location.txt


S10 and API 29 "workaround"
at the time of this writing...

MG pipeline builder MUST be Android

Port.txt
Images only seem to work as PNG i.e. jpg didn't seem to convert
Sound only seemed to work for mp3 i.e. wav files didn't seem to convert
therefore have mp3 for all music + sound effects except make music as song and sfx as Sound Instance
