Wrote initial Android apps using MonoGame 3.4
2018 prototype 3D stuff but used latest version of MG for Android e.g. 3.6
Create new project creates new project template layout

22/10/2019
CK upload
Fail because mismatch certificate
So upload on old PC and get new error: not 64-bit compliant
So build against arm64-v8a instead of [old] armeabi-v7
Error: audio not supported for 64-bit in old 3.4 version of MG
So upgrade MG library / package to 3.7 but get error 'cos can't load content


23/10/2019
I know that I had working load content in 2018 w/ 3D prototype stuff
so try to replicate that
That's where I realized that my old CK Android project templates are different from new 3.7
So try to create hello world style app Android to refresh how to do
Get working - here is what is required

Create new Android project
Content load Content.mgcb in MG content pipeline builder
IMPORTANT
Ensure top level node Platfor set to Android
Add AndroidManifest.xml
Ensure that at least one architecture supported
e.g. for testing 64-bit arm64-v8a
[project properties | Android Options | Advanced]
if no architecture set then will build run stop
Ensure debug build configuration set to deploy!

Comment out this line
//Content.RootDirectory = "Content";

and manually include "Content" in the asset name path [as I do in my projects anyway]
image = Content.Load<Texture2D>("Content/ship_tex");
