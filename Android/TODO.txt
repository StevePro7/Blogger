Android upload for 3D City on Mac

Can I export the keystore and keep in source control
What are all the passwords and keys etc for keystore


Google
Project properties
do I want to enter values for "Android Package Signing"?
where I enter all the keystore data and build signed APK directly?


Apple
repeat this for VS2017 and ensure MG Pipeline is the same
i.e.
for completeness could upgrade all 3x games on iOS to new style and upload to prove this would be correct going forwards



Ensure all code is consistent across all repos as there's been a lot of changes here and there...
Is the Summary an opportunity to "switch" SVN + externals to Git + submodules

SUMMARY
All hard work not in vein as requirement to upgrade to 3.7 and use latest MG pipeline builder
esp. if want to push and do 3D models + graphics using custom shaders
as this was possible in XNA 4.0 but not in first MS phone option WP7 as certainly not in earlier versions of MG
e.g. 3.4 or 3.5 but now seems matured in 3.7 to work w/o issue :)


Error
403 if APK signed with different certificate
e.g.
