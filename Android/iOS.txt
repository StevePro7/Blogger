Once you upgrade to MG 3.7.1 and build out to iOS device
if you get an error like iOS error then maybe just need to reconnect iOS device to Mac
and re-update the MonoFramework SDK and Xamarin iOS framework to the latest version


IMPORTANT
You may be prompted to update MonoFramework on the Mac itself or re-install


WORKFLOW
Launch VS2017
New / open Xamarin.iOS MG project

Mono versions mismatch
The Mono version installed on Mac may not be compatible with this verison of Visual Studio.
Would you like us to install Mono '5.18' for you?
This will overwrite any existing Mono installation on your Mac.

Install

when you do this then you will be able to build + run code out from Windows to Mac
via iPhone simulator or, if you have the bundle identifier + provisioning profiles setup for an iOS device, iPhone

However, after development you will need to complete deployment
and this can only be done on the Mac

Therefore, when you launch Visual Studio for Mac you may be prompted to install MonoFramework due to MDK mismatch
If you re-install MonoFramework then you will be able to launch Visual Studio for Mac and complete deployment

SOLUTION?
On Windows I have the latest build of MG 3.7.189 but I thought that I had the latest build of MG on the Mac
I downloaded and installed the latest version of MG on the Mac but when I launched Visual Studio for Mac
I was prompted to update Mono Framework MDK 6.4.0.208 and Xamarin.iOS 13.4.0.2
I wonder if this was the constant source of the mismatch issue

Update on Mac and retry on Windows
Still get the same error msg on Windows when launch Xamarin.iOS project in VS2017
so the solution is to launch Xamarin.iOS project in VS2019...!!

Now, will NOT be prompted to mismatch Mono framework version 5.18
