Once you upgrade to MG 3.7.1 and build out to iOS device
if you get an error like iOS error then maybe just need to reconnect iOS device to Mac
and re-update the MonoFramework SDK and Xamarin iOS framework to the latest version


IMPORTANT
You may be prompted to update MonoFramework on the Mac itself or re-install
