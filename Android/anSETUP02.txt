Can't update Android SDK Build Tools in Visual Studio 2019
https://superuser.com/questions/1447005/cant-update-android-sdk-build-tools-in-visual-studio-2019

User circumvent the problem by doing manually download and copy across
https://androidsdkmanager.azurewebsites.net/Buildtools


THIS WORKED
Abit hacky but this works

Install MonoGame
Can create Android project in VS2017 but NO project template in VS2019 [currently]

Install Android Studio
This will install android-29 for Android 10.0 (API Level 29 - Q)

Create new Android project in VS2017
build and run with default values

NB: add AndroidManifest.xml as necessary

In VS2019
Minimum Android version:	Android 9.0 (API Level 28 - Pie)
Target Android version:		Android 10.0 (API Level 29 - Q)

Why?
This is a reminder that starting November 1, 2019, updates to apps and games on Google Play will be required to target Android 9 (API level 28) or higher. After this date, the Play Console will prevent you from submitting new APKs with a targetSdkVersion less than 28.


build will fail because android-29 does not exist at
C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk

Tools | Android | Android SDK Manager
can only install up to Android 9.0 (API Level 28 - Pie)

Therefore, manually copy android-29 from Android Studio SDK folder to Visual Studio SDK folder
that is copy the following 2x folders:

C:\Users\22627\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\29.0.2
to here
C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\build-tools

and
C:\Users\22627\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platforms\android-29
to here
C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platforms

Now VS2019 will build OK and can deploy to Android phone
